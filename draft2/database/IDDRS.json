In a peacekeeping context, this trend has been part of a move towards complex operations that seek to deal with a wide variety of issues ranging from security to human rights, rule of law, elections and economic governance, rather than traditional peacekeeping where two warring parties were separated by a ceasefire line patrolled by blue-helmeted soldiers.",

The definition includes girls recruited for sexual purposes and for forced marriage. It does not, therefore, only refer to a child who is carrying or has carried arms.”\\nIn his February 2000 report to the UN Security Council, the SecretaryGeneral defined a child soldier “as any person under the age 18 years of age who forms part of an armed force in any capacity and those accompanying such groups, other than purely as family members, as well as girls recruited for sexual purposes and forced marriage”. The CRC specifies that a child is every human below the age of 18.\\nThe term ‘children associated with armed forces and groups’, although more cumbersome, is now used to avoid the perception that the only children of concern are combatant boys. It points out that children eligible for release and reintegration programmes are both those associated with armed forces and groups and those who fled armed forces and groups (often considered as deserters and therefore requiring support and protection), children who were abducted, those forcibly married and those in detention.\\nAccess to demobilization does not depend on a child’s level of involvement in armed forces and groups. No distinction is made between combatants and non-combatants for fear of unfair treatment, oversight or exclusion (mainly of girls). Nevertheless, the child’s personal history and activities in the armed conflict can help decide on the kind of support he/she needs in the reintegration phase.",

Gender is part of the broader sociocultural context. Other important criteria for sociocultural analysis include class, race, poverty level, ethnic group and age. The concept of gender also includes the expectations held about the characteristics, aptitudes and likely behaviours of both women and men (femininity and masculinity). The concept of gender is vital, because, when it is applied to social analysis, it reveals how women’s subordination (or men’s domination) is socially constructed. As such, the subordination can be changed or ended. It is not biologically predetermined, nor is it fixed forever. As with any group, interactions among armed forces and groups, members’ roles and responsibilities within the group, and interactions between members of armed forces/groups and policy and decision makers are all heavily influenced by prevailing gender roles and gender relations in society.

It can consist of taking cultural traditions and values into consideration, depending on where the DDR process is taking place. For ex-combatants, their dependants and surrounding communities who are being sensitized, it means being prepared for and made aware of what will happen to them and their communities after being disarmed and demobilized, e.g., taking on new livelihoods, which will change both their lifestyle and environment.

There remains a real danger that violence will flare up again during the immediate post-conflict period, because putting right the political, security, social and economic problems and other root causes of war is a long-term project. Furthermore, peace operations are often mandated in contexts where an agreement is yet to be reached or where a peace process is yet to be initiated or is only partially initiated. In non-mission contexts, requests from the Government for the UN to support DDR are made either when ceasefires are reached or when a peace agreement or a comprehensive peace agreement is signed. This is why practitioners should decide whether DDR programmes, DDR-related tools and/or reintegration support constitute the most appropriate response to a particular situation. A DDR programme will only be appropriate when the preconditions referred to above are in place.",

Trust and commitment by the parties to the implementation of an agreement and minimum conditions of security are essential for the success of a DDR programme.

Both may require the full registration of weapons and personnel, followed by the collection of information, referral and counselling that are needed before effective reintegration programmes can be put in place. \\nThe rightsizing of armed forces or police: Governments may request assistance to downsize or restructure their armies or police and supporting institutional infrastructure (salaries, benefits, basic services, etc.). Such processes contribute to security sector reform (SSR) (see IDDRS 6.10 on DDR and Security Sector Reform). DDR practitioners should work in close collaboration with SSR experts while planning reintegration support to former members of armed forces. \\nThe repatriation of foreign combatants and associated groups: Considering the regional dimensions of conflict, Governments may agree to assistance to repatriation. DDR programmes may need to become involved in repatriating national combatants and their civilian family members, as well as children associated with armed forces and groups who may have crossed an international border. Such repatriation needs to be in accordance with the principle of non-refoulement, as set out in international humanitarian, human rights and refugee law (see IDDRS 2.11 on The Legal Framework for UN DDR).",

The importance of planning and initiating reinsertion and reintegration support activities at the start of a DDR programme has become increasingly evident, so adequate financing for reintegration needs to be secured in advance. This should help to prevent delays or gaps in implementation that could threaten or undermine the programme’s credibility and viability (see IDDRS 3.41 on Finance and Budgeting).",

Peace agreements can take a variety of forms, ranging from local-level agreements to national-level ceasefires and Comprehensive Peace Agreements (see IDDRS 2.20 on The Politics of DDR). Following the conclusion of an agreement, a DDR policy document may also be developed by the Government and the signatory armed groups, often with UN support.

In addition to these principles, the following general guiding principles related specifically to the legal framework apply when carrying out DDR processes. \\n Abide by the applicable legal framework. The applicable legal framework should be a core consideration at all stages, when drafting, designing, executing and evaluating DDR processes. Failure to abide by the applicable legal framework may result in consequences for the UN entity involved and the UN more generally, including possible liabilities. It may also lead to personal accountability for the DDR practitioner(s) involved. \\n Know your mandate. DDR practitioners should be familiar with the source and scope of their mandate. To the extent that their involvement in the DDR process requires coordination and/or cooperation with other UN system actors, they should also know the respective roles and responsibilities of those other actors. If a peace agreement exists, it should be one of the first documents that DDR practitioners consult to understand the framework in which they will carry out the DDR process. \\n Develop a concept of operations (CONOPS). DDR practitioners should have a common, agreed approach in order to ensure coherence amongst UN system-supported DDR processes and coordination among the various UN system actors that are conducting DDR in a particular context. This can be achieved through a written CONOPS, developed in consultation, as necessary, with the relevant headquarters. The CONOPS can also be adjusted to include the legal obligations of the UN system actor. \\n Develop operation-specific standard operating procedures (SOPs) or guidelines for DDR. Consistent with the CONOPS, DDR practitioners should consider developing operation-specific SOPs or guidelines. These may address, for instance, standards for cooperation with criminal justice and other accountability processes, measures for controlling access to DDR encampments or other installations, measures for the safe handling and destruction of weapons and ammunition, and other relevant issues. They may also include references to, and explanations of, the applicable legal standards. \\n Include legal considerations in all relevant project documents. In general, legal considerations should be integrated and addressed, as appropriate, in all relevant written project documents, including those agreed with the host State. \\n Seek legal advice. As a general matter, DDR practitioners should seek legal advice when they are in doubt as to whether a situation raises legal concerns. In particular, DDR practitioners should seek advice when they foresee new elements or significant changes in their DDR processes (e.g., when a new type of activity or new partners are involved). It is important to know where, and how, such advice may be requested and obtained. Familiarity with the legal office in-country and having clear channels of communication for seeking expeditious advice from headquarters are critical.",

States parties agree to take all appropriate measures, including legislation and temporary special measures, so that women can enjoy all their human rights and fundamental freedoms. General recommendation No. 30 on women in conflict prevention, conflict and post-conflict situations, issued by the CEDAW Committee in 2013, specifically recommends that States parties, among others, ensure (a) women’s participation in all stages of DDR processes; (b) that DDR processes specifically target female combatants and women and girls associated with armed groups and that barriers to their equitable participation are addressed; (c) that mental health and psychosocial support as well as other support services are provided to them; and (d) that DDR processes specifically address women’s distinct needs in order to provide age and gender-specific DDR support. \\n The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (2006) (CRPD) clarifies and qualifies how all categories of rights apply to persons with disabilities and identifies areas where adaptations have to be made for persons with disabilities to effectively exercise their rights, and where protection of rights must be reinforced. This is also relevant for people with psychosocial, intellectual and cognitive disabilities, and is a key legislative framework addressing their human rights including the right to quality services and the right to community integration. \\n The International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance (2006) (ICPPED) establishes that enforced disappearances are prohibited under all circumstances, including in times of war or a threat of war, internal political instability or other public emergency.",
