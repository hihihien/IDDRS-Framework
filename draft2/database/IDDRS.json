In a peacekeeping context, this trend has been part of a move towards complex operations that seek to deal with a wide variety of issues ranging from security to human rights, rule of law, elections and economic governance, rather than traditional peacekeeping where two warring parties were separated by a ceasefire line patrolled by blue-helmeted soldiers.",

The definition includes girls recruited for sexual purposes and for forced marriage. It does not, therefore, only refer to a child who is carrying or has carried arms.”\\nIn his February 2000 report to the UN Security Council, the SecretaryGeneral defined a child soldier “as any person under the age 18 years of age who forms part of an armed force in any capacity and those accompanying such groups, other than purely as family members, as well as girls recruited for sexual purposes and forced marriage”. The CRC specifies that a child is every human below the age of 18.\\nThe term ‘children associated with armed forces and groups’, although more cumbersome, is now used to avoid the perception that the only children of concern are combatant boys. It points out that children eligible for release and reintegration programmes are both those associated with armed forces and groups and those who fled armed forces and groups (often considered as deserters and therefore requiring support and protection), children who were abducted, those forcibly married and those in detention.\\nAccess to demobilization does not depend on a child’s level of involvement in armed forces and groups. No distinction is made between combatants and non-combatants for fear of unfair treatment, oversight or exclusion (mainly of girls). Nevertheless, the child’s personal history and activities in the armed conflict can help decide on the kind of support he/she needs in the reintegration phase.",

Gender is part of the broader sociocultural context. Other important criteria for sociocultural analysis include class, race, poverty level, ethnic group and age. The concept of gender also includes the expectations held about the characteristics, aptitudes and likely behaviours of both women and men (femininity and masculinity). The concept of gender is vital, because, when it is applied to social analysis, it reveals how women’s subordination (or men’s domination) is socially constructed. As such, the subordination can be changed or ended. It is not biologically predetermined, nor is it fixed forever. As with any group, interactions among armed forces and groups, members’ roles and responsibilities within the group, and interactions between members of armed forces/groups and policy and decision makers are all heavily influenced by prevailing gender roles and gender relations in society.

It can consist of taking cultural traditions and values into consideration, depending on where the DDR process is taking place. For ex-combatants, their dependants and surrounding communities who are being sensitized, it means being prepared for and made aware of what will happen to them and their communities after being disarmed and demobilized, e.g., taking on new livelihoods, which will change both their lifestyle and environment.

There remains a real danger that violence will flare up again during the immediate post-conflict period, because putting right the political, security, social and economic problems and other root causes of war is a long-term project. Furthermore, peace operations are often mandated in contexts where an agreement is yet to be reached or where a peace process is yet to be initiated or is only partially initiated. In non-mission contexts, requests from the Government for the UN to support DDR are made either when ceasefires are reached or when a peace agreement or a comprehensive peace agreement is signed. This is why practitioners should decide whether DDR programmes, DDR-related tools and/or reintegration support constitute the most appropriate response to a particular situation. A DDR programme will only be appropriate when the preconditions referred to above are in place.",

Trust and commitment by the parties to the implementation of an agreement and minimum conditions of security are essential for the success of a DDR programme.

Both may require the full registration of weapons and personnel, followed by the collection of information, referral and counselling that are needed before effective reintegration programmes can be put in place. \\nThe rightsizing of armed forces or police: Governments may request assistance to downsize or restructure their armies or police and supporting institutional infrastructure (salaries, benefits, basic services, etc.). Such processes contribute to security sector reform (SSR) (see IDDRS 6.10 on DDR and Security Sector Reform). DDR practitioners should work in close collaboration with SSR experts while planning reintegration support to former members of armed forces. \\nThe repatriation of foreign combatants and associated groups: Considering the regional dimensions of conflict, Governments may agree to assistance to repatriation. DDR programmes may need to become involved in repatriating national combatants and their civilian family members, as well as children associated with armed forces and groups who may have crossed an international border. Such repatriation needs to be in accordance with the principle of non-refoulement, as set out in international humanitarian, human rights and refugee law (see IDDRS 2.11 on The Legal Framework for UN DDR).",

The importance of planning and initiating reinsertion and reintegration support activities at the start of a DDR programme has become increasingly evident, so adequate financing for reintegration needs to be secured in advance. This should help to prevent delays or gaps in implementation that could threaten or undermine the programme’s credibility and viability (see IDDRS 3.41 on Finance and Budgeting).",

Peace agreements can take a variety of forms, ranging from local-level agreements to national-level ceasefires and Comprehensive Peace Agreements (see IDDRS 2.20 on The Politics of DDR). Following the conclusion of an agreement, a DDR policy document may also be developed by the Government and the signatory armed groups, often with UN support.

In addition to these principles, the following general guiding principles related specifically to the legal framework apply when carrying out DDR processes. \\n Abide by the applicable legal framework. The applicable legal framework should be a core consideration at all stages, when drafting, designing, executing and evaluating DDR processes. Failure to abide by the applicable legal framework may result in consequences for the UN entity involved and the UN more generally, including possible liabilities. It may also lead to personal accountability for the DDR practitioner(s) involved. \\n Know your mandate. DDR practitioners should be familiar with the source and scope of their mandate. To the extent that their involvement in the DDR process requires coordination and/or cooperation with other UN system actors, they should also know the respective roles and responsibilities of those other actors. If a peace agreement exists, it should be one of the first documents that DDR practitioners consult to understand the framework in which they will carry out the DDR process. \\n Develop a concept of operations (CONOPS). DDR practitioners should have a common, agreed approach in order to ensure coherence amongst UN system-supported DDR processes and coordination among the various UN system actors that are conducting DDR in a particular context. This can be achieved through a written CONOPS, developed in consultation, as necessary, with the relevant headquarters. The CONOPS can also be adjusted to include the legal obligations of the UN system actor. \\n Develop operation-specific standard operating procedures (SOPs) or guidelines for DDR. Consistent with the CONOPS, DDR practitioners should consider developing operation-specific SOPs or guidelines. These may address, for instance, standards for cooperation with criminal justice and other accountability processes, measures for controlling access to DDR encampments or other installations, measures for the safe handling and destruction of weapons and ammunition, and other relevant issues. They may also include references to, and explanations of, the applicable legal standards. \\n Include legal considerations in all relevant project documents. In general, legal considerations should be integrated and addressed, as appropriate, in all relevant written project documents, including those agreed with the host State. \\n Seek legal advice. As a general matter, DDR practitioners should seek legal advice when they are in doubt as to whether a situation raises legal concerns. In particular, DDR practitioners should seek advice when they foresee new elements or significant changes in their DDR processes (e.g., when a new type of activity or new partners are involved). It is important to know where, and how, such advice may be requested and obtained. Familiarity with the legal office in-country and having clear channels of communication for seeking expeditious advice from headquarters are critical.",

States parties agree to take all appropriate measures, including legislation and temporary special measures, so that women can enjoy all their human rights and fundamental freedoms. General recommendation No. 30 on women in conflict prevention, conflict and post-conflict situations, issued by the CEDAW Committee in 2013, specifically recommends that States parties, among others, ensure (a) women’s participation in all stages of DDR processes; (b) that DDR processes specifically target female combatants and women and girls associated with armed groups and that barriers to their equitable participation are addressed; (c) that mental health and psychosocial support as well as other support services are provided to them; and (d) that DDR processes specifically address women’s distinct needs in order to provide age and gender-specific DDR support. \\n The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (2006) (CRPD) clarifies and qualifies how all categories of rights apply to persons with disabilities and identifies areas where adaptations have to be made for persons with disabilities to effectively exercise their rights, and where protection of rights must be reinforced. This is also relevant for people with psychosocial, intellectual and cognitive disabilities, and is a key legislative framework addressing their human rights including the right to quality services and the right to community integration. \\n The International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance (2006) (ICPPED) establishes that enforced disappearances are prohibited under all circumstances, including in times of war or a threat of war, internal political instability or other public emergency.",

Analysis of armed forces and groups should include the following: \\n Leadership: Including associated political leaders or structures (see below) and other persons who may have influence over the warring parties. The analysis should take into account external actors, including possible foreign supporters but also exiled leaders or others who may have some control over armed groups. It should also consider how much control the leadership has over the combatants and to what extent the leadership is representative of its members. Both control and representativeness can change over time. \\n Internal group dynamics: Including the balance between an organization’s po- litical and military wings, interactions between prominent members or factions within an armed force or group and how they influence the behaviour of the or- ganization, internal conflict patterns and potential fragmentation, the presence of female fighters or women associated with armed forces and groups (WAAFG), gender norms in the group, and the existence and pervasiveness of sexual violence. \\n Associated political leaders and structures: Including whether warring parties have a separate political branch or are integrated politico-military movements and how this shapes their agenda. Are women involved in political structures, and if so to what extent? Armed groups with separate political structures or a history of political engagement prior to the conflict have sometimes been more successful at transforming themselves into political parties, although this potential may erode during a prolonged conflict. \\n Associated religious leaders: Are religious leaders or personalities associated with the armed groups? What role could they play in peace negotiations? Do they have influence on the warring parties, and how can they help to shape the outcome of peace efforts? \\n Linkages with their base: Is a given armed group close to a political base or a popu- lation, and how do these linkages influence the group? Has this support been weak- ened by the use of certain tactics or actions (e.g., mass atrocities), or will repression of its base influence the armed group? Will efforts to demobilize combatants affect the armed group’s relations with its base or otherwise push it to change tactics – for instance eschewing violence so as to mobilize a political base that would otherwise reject violence. \\n Linkages with local, national and regional elites: Including influential indi- viduals or groups who hold sway over the armed forces and groups. These could include business people or communities, religious or traditional leaders or insti- tutions such as trade unions or cultural groupings. The diaspora may also be an important actor, providing political and economic support to communities and/or armed groups. \\n External support: Are there regional and/or broader international actors or net- works that provide political and financial support to armed groups, including on the basis of geopolitical interests? This might include State sponsors, diaspora or political exiles, transnational criminal networks or ideological affiliation and ‘franchising’ with foreign, often extremist, armed groups.",

            "Paragraph": "The way a conflict ends can influence the political dynamics of DDR. The following scenarios should be considered: \\n A clear victor: This usually results in a ‘victor’s peace’, where the winner can ‘im- pose’ demands on the party that lost the conflict. This may mean that the armed structures of the victor are preserved, while the losing party will be the one tar- geted for DDR. Less emphasis may be placed on the reintegration of the defeated combatants, and the stigma of being an ex-combatant or person formerly associated with an armed force or group (including children associated with armed forces and groups [CAAFG] and WAAFG) is compounded by that of having been a part of a defeated group, resulting in increased marginalization, exclusion and discrim- ination. The victorious group may seek to dominate the new security structures. \\n A negotiated process: At the national level, this is the most common form of con- flict resolution and often results in a comprehensive peace agreement (CPA) that addresses the political aspects of a conflict and might include provisions for DDR (this is considered a prerequisite for a DDR programme). Negotiated processes can also lead to local-level peace agreements, which can be followed by DDR- related tools such as CVR and transitional weapons and ammunition management (WAM) or reintegration support. DDR processes that are the outcome of negotiations (whether local or national) are more likely to be acceptable to warring parties. However, unless expert advice is provided, the DDR-related clauses in such agree- ments can be unrealistic. \\n Partial peace: In some conflicts the multiplicity of armed groups may result in peace processes that are not fully inclusive, since some of the armed groups are excluded from or refuse to sign the agreement. This can be a disincentive for signatory armed groups to disarm and demobilize due to fear for their security and that of the population they represent, concerns over loss of territory to a non- signatory armed group or uncertainty about how their political position might be affected should other armed groups eventually join the peace process.",

Local agendas – at the level of the individual, family, clan, municipality, community, district or ethnic group – can at least partly drive the continuation of violence. Some incidents of localized violence, such as clashes between rivals over positions of tradi- tional authority between two clans, will require primarily local solutions. However, other types of localized armed conflict may be intrinsically linked to the national level, and more amenable to top-down intervention. An example would be competition over political roles at the subfederal or district level. Experience shows that international interventions often neglect local mediation and conflict resolution, focusing instead on national-level cleavages. However, in many instances a combination of local and national conflict or dispute resolution mechanisms, including traditional ones, may be required. For these reasons, local political dynamics should be assessed.",

Another common underlying expectation is that CVR projects will contribute to social cohesion. In socially cohesive communities, com- munity members feel that they belong to the community, that there is trust between community members, and that community members can work together. Members of socially cohesive communities are more likely to be aware of, and more likely to inter- vene when they see, behaviour that may lead to violence.

If reintegration support is delayed, CVR can serve as a stop-gap measure, providing temporary reinsertion assistance for a defined period (6–18 months) (also see IDDRS 4.20 on Demobilization). \\n Members of armed groups who are not formally eligible for a DDR programme because their group is not signatory to a peace agreement. These groups may include rebel factions, paramilitaries, militia groups, members of armed gangs or other entities that are not part of a peace agreement. This category may include individuals who voluntarily leave active armed groups, including those that are designated as terrorist organizations by the United Nations Security Council (see IDDRS 2.11 on The Legal Framework for UN DDR). The status of these individuals and armed groups must be analysed and specified to mitigate any risks associated with their inclusion in CVR programmes. \\n Individuals who are not members of an armed group, but who are at risk of re- cruitment by such groups. These individuals are not part of an established armed group and are therefore ineligible to participate in a DDR programme. They do, however, exhibit the potential to build peace and to contribute to the prevention of recruitment in their community. This wide category of beneficiaries can include male and female children and youth (see IDDRS 5.20 on Children and DDR and 5.30 on Youth and DDR). \\n Designated communities that are susceptible to outbreaks of violence, close to cantonment sites, or likely to receive former combatants. In some cases, CVR may target communities and neighbourhoods that are situated close to cantonment sites and/or vulnerable to high rates of political violence, organized crime, or sex- ual or gender-based violence.

In non-mission settings, funding for CVR and reintegration support will depend on the allocation of national budgets and/or voluntary contributions from donors. Therefore, in instances where CVR and support to communi- ty-based reintegration are both envisaged in a non-mission setting, they should, from the outset, be planned and implemented as a single and continuous programme.

Although the return of a weapon is not typically a condition of partic- ipation in CVR, voluntary returns may demonstrate the willingness of beneficiaries to engage. Moreover, the removal and/or safe storage of weapons from individuals’ or armed groups’ inventories may help reduce open carrying and home possession of weaponry – factors that can contribute to violent exchanges and unintentional injuries. Even when weapons are not handed over as part of a CVR programme, it is beneficial to collect information on the weapons still in possession of those participating in CVR. This is because weapons in circulation will continue to represent a risk factor and have the potential to facilitate violence.

The twin UN resolutions on the 2015 peacebuilding architecture review, General Assembly resolution 70/262 and Security Council resolution 2282, recognize that efforts to sustain peace are necessary at all stages of conflict. This renewed UN policy engagement emerges from the need to address ongoing armed conflicts that are often protracted and complex.

It is also important to strengthen what still works, including the residual capacities for peace that people and communities draw on in times of conflict.

These negative patterns may also serve to increase vulnerability to involvement in armed groups and other criminal behaviour. The specific needs of women and girls formerly associated with armed forces and groups also need to be addressed, including preventing and addressing sexual and gender-based violence.",

As a result, reintegration support may only play an effective role in conflict prevention when these needs are acknowledged and addressed comprehensively. Thus, reintegration programmes can help to prevent conflict only when they account for: \\n The motivations of individuals to engage in and leave armed groups; \\n The criminogenic, or crime-inducing, risks present in the context that may impede sustained reintegration and increase vulnerability to involvement in armed groups and other criminal behaviour; \\n Local needs and existing capacities; \\n The strengthened resilience of individuals, families, communities and institutions to cope with adversity and to withstand violence and conflict-related pressures.",

Planning for DDR in contexts with weak or non-existent national institutions will differ greatly from planning DDR in contexts with stable and effective national institutions; \\n The role of the UN: How the role of the UN is defined in general terms, and for DDR specifically, will depend on the extent of responsibility and direct involvement assumed by national actors, and the UN’s own capacity to complement and support these efforts. This role definition will directly influence the scope and nature of the UN’s engagement in DDR, and hence requirements for planning; \\n Interaction with other international and regional actors: The presence and need to collaborate with international or regional actors (e.g., the European Union, NATO, the African Union, the Economic Community of West African States) with a current or potential role in the management of the conflict will affect the general planning process.",

DDR planning takes place within this broader integrated mission planning process; \\n Integration: The integrated approach to planning tries to develop, to the extent possible: \\n\\n a common framework (i.e., one that everyone involved uses) for developing, man- aging, funding and implementing a UN DDR strategy within the context of a peace mission; \\n\\n an integrated DDR management structure (unit or section), with the participation of staff from participating UN agencies and primary reporting lines to the Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General (DSRSG) for humanitarian and development affairs. Such an approach should include the co-location of staff, infrastructure and resources, as this allows for increased efficiency and reduced overhead costs, and brings about more responsive planning, implementation and coordination; \\n\\n joint programmes that harness UN country team and mission resources into a single process and results-based approach to putting the DDR strategy into operation and achieving shared objectives; \\n\\n a single framework for managing multiple sources of funding, as well as for co- ordinating funding mechanisms, thus ensuring that resources are used to deal with common priorities and needs; Efficient and effective planning: At the planning stage, a common DDR strategy and work plan should be developed on the basis of joint assessments and evaluation. This should establish a set of operational objectives, activities and expected results that all UN entities involved in DDR will use as the basis for their programming and implemen- tation activities. A common resource mobilization strategy involving all participating UN entities should be established within the integrated DDR framework in order to prevent duplication, and ensure coordination with donors and national authorities, and coherent and efficient planning.",

It is therefore essential that the departure of the peacekeeping mission is planned with the UN country team as early as possible to ensure that capacities are sufficiently built up in the country team for it to assume the full financial, logistic and human resources responsibilities for the continuation of the longer-term aspects of the DDR programme. A second essential requirement is the building of national capacities to assume full responsibility for the DDR programme, which should begin from the start of the DDR programme.",

The scope and depth of this detailed field assessment will depend on the amount of information gathered in previous assessments, such as the technical assessment mission. The current political and military situation in the country concerned and the amount of access possible to areas where combatants are located should also be carefully considered; \\n Thematic areas of focus: The detailed field assessment should deepen understanding, analysis and assessments conducted in the pre­mission period. It therefore builds on information gathered on the following thematic areas: \\n\\n political, social and economic context and background; \\n\\n causes, dynamics and consequences of the armed conflict; \\n\\n identification of specific groups, potential partners and others involved in the discussion process; \\n\\n distribution, availability and proliferation of weapons (primarily small arms and light weapons); \\n\\n institutional capacities of national stakeholders in areas related to DDR; \\n\\n survey of socio­economic conditions and local capacities to absorb ex­combatants and their dependants; \\n\\n preconditions and other factors that will influence DDR; \\n\\n baseline data and performance indicators for programme design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation. \\n\\n (Also see Annex B of IDDRS 3.10 on Integrated DDR Planning: Processes and Structures.); \\n Expertise: The next step is to identify the DDR expertise required. Assessment teams should be composed of specialists in all aspects of DDR (see IDDRS Level 5 for more information on the different needs that have to be met during a DDR mission). To ensure coherence with the political process and overall objectives of the peacekeeping mandate, the assessment should be led by a member of the UN DDR unit; \\n Local participation: Where the political situation allows, national and local participation in the assessment should be emphasized to ensure that local analyses of the situation, the needs and appropriate solutions are reflected and included in the DDR pro­ gramme. There is a need, however, to be aware of local bias, especially in the tense immediate post­conflict environment; \\n Building confidence and managing expectations: Where possible, detailed field assessments should be linked with preparatory assistance projects and initiatives (e.g., community development programmes and quick­impact projects) to build confidence in and support for the DDR programme. Care must be taken, however, not to raise unrealistic expec­ tations of the DDR programme; \\n Design of the field assessment: Before starting the assessment, DDR practitioners should: \\n\\n identify the research objectives and indicators (what are we assessing?); \\n\\n identify the sources and methods for data collection (where are we going to obtain our information?); \\n\\n develop appropriate analytical tools and techniques (how are we going to make sense of our data?); \\n\\n develop a method for interpreting the findings in a practical way (how are we going to apply the results?); \\n Being flexible: Thinking about and answering these questions are essential to developing a well­designed approach and work plan that allows for a systematic and well­structured data collection process. Naturally, the approach will change once data collection begins in the field, but this should not in any way reduce its importance as an initial guiding blueprint.",

Given the large geographical areas in which DDR assessments are carried out, estimating and extrapolating based on a representative sample is the only way to obtain an idea of the ‘bigger picture’; \\n Triangulation (cross­referencing), or the comparison of results from three different methods or data sources, helps to confirm the validity of data collected in contexts where infor­mation is fragmentary, imprecise or unreliable. Although normally used with direct observation and interviewing (where facts are confirmed by using three or more differ­ ent sources), triangulation can also be applied between different methods, to increase the probability of reaching a reasonably accurate result, and to maximize reliability and validity; \\n Geographic/Demographic mapping, which draws on all the techniques mentioned above, involves plotting the information gained about participants and beneficiaries geo­ graphically (i.e., the way they are spread over a geographical area) or chronologically (over time) to determine their concentration, spread and any changes over time.",

These provide a strategic framework for organizing and anchoring relevant activities and outputs; \\n Baseline data: For each specific objective, the initial starting point should be briefly described. In the absence of hard quantitative baseline data, give a qualitative descrip­ tion of the current situation. Defining the baseline is a critical part of monitoring and evaluating the performance and impact of programmes; \\n Indicative activities: For each objective, a list of indicative activities should be provided in order to give a sense of the range and kind of activities that need to be implemented so as to achieve the expected outputs and objectives. For the general results frame­ work, these do not need to be complete or highly detailed, but they must be sufficient to provide a sense of the underlying strategy, scope and range of actions that will be implemented; \\n Intervals: Activities and priority outputs should be have precise time­lines (preferably specific dates). For each of these dates, indicate the expected level of result that should be achieved. This should allow an overview of how each relevant component of the programme is expected to progress over time and what has to be achieved by what date; \\n Targets and monitoring indicators: For each activity there should be an observable target, objectively verifiable and useful as a monitoring indicator. These indicators will vary depending on the activity, and they do not always have to be quantitative. For example, ‘reduction in perceptions of violence’ is as useful as ‘15 percent of ex­combatants success­ fully reintegrated’; \\n Inputs: For each activity or output there should be an indication of inputs and their costs. General cost categories should be used to identify the essential requirements, which can include staff, infrastructure, equipment, operating expenses, service contracts, grants, consultancies, etc.",

Taken together, these will affect the degree to which a given government can take effective ownership of and responsibility for DDR; \\n Technical capacities and knowledge: Even when post-conflict governments are legitimate and capable, they may lack the specific technical knowledge that is needed to link DDR to a national reconstruction plan and SSR; \\n Participation of civil society: In many post-conflict situations, civil society may have been repressed or marginalized and lack access to political decision-making processes. The representation of civil society at all levels in the body politic is essential, and the UN should support the participation and engagement of civil society in DDR processes wherever possible. Possible roles may include involvement in the policy development process (and particularly its link with transitional justice and equity issues); assistance with the identification of people associated with armed groups and forces, especially women and children; and implementing (particularly focusing on the involvement of local communities) and monitoring the effectiveness of DDR programmes.",

            "Paragraph": "UN support to national efforts take place in the following areas (the actual degree of UN engagement should be determined on the basis of the considerations outlined above): \\n Political/Strategic support: In order for the international community to provide political support to the DDR process, it is essential to understand the dynamics of both the conflict and the post-conflict period. By carrying out a stakeholder analysis (as part of a larger conflict assessment process), it will be possible to better understand the dynam- ics among national actors, and to identify DDR supporters and potential spoilers; \\n Institutional capacity development: It is important that capacity development strategies are established jointly with national authorities at the start of international involvement in DDR to ensure that the parties themselves take ownership of and responsibility for the success of the process. The UN system should play an important role in supporting the development of national and local capacities for DDR through providing technical assistance, establishing partnership arrangements with national institutions, and pro- viding training and capacity-building to local implementing partners; \\n Support for the establishment of legal frameworks: A key area in which international exper- tise can support the development of national capacities is in the drawing up of legal frameworks for DDR and related processes of SSR and weapons management. The UN system should draw on experiences from a range of political and legal systems, and assist national authorities in drafting appropriate legislation and legal instruments; \\n Technical assistance for policy and planning: Through the provision of technical assistance, the UN system should provide direct support to the development of national DDR policy and programmes. It is important to ensure, however, that this assistance is provided through partnership or mentoring arrangements that allow for knowledge and skills transfers to national staff, and to avoid situations where international experts take direct responsibility for programme functions within national institutions. When several international institutions are providing technical assistance to national authori- ties, it is important to ensure that this assistance is coordinated and coherent; \\n Direct support for implementation and financial management: The UN system may also be called upon, either by Security Council mandate or at the request of national authorities, to provide direct support for the implementation of certain components of a DDR pro- gramme, including the financial management of resources for DDR. A memorandum of understanding should be established between the UN and national authorities that defines the precise area of responsibility for programme delivery, mechanisms for co- ordination with local partners and clear reporting responsibilities; \\n Material/Logistic support: In the post-conflict period, many national institutions lack both material and human resources. The UN system should provide material and logistic support to national DDR institutions and implementing agencies, particularly in the areas of: information and communications technology and equipment; transportation; rehabilitation, design and management of DDR sites, transit centres and other facilities; the establishment of information management and referral systems; and the procurement of basic goods for reinsertion kits, among others (also see IDDRS 4.10 on Disarmament, IDDRS 4.20 on Demobilization and IDDRS 4.30 on Social and Economic Reintegration); \\n Training programmes for national staff: The UN system should further support capacity development through the provision of training. There are a number of different training methodologies, including the provision of courses or seminars, training of trainers, on- the-job or continuous training, and exchanges with experts from other national DDR institutions. Although shortage of time and money may limit the training options that can be offered, it is important that the approach chosen builds skills through a continuous process of capacity development that transfers skills to local actors; \\n Support to local capacity development and community empowerment: Through local capacity development and community empowerment, the UN system should support local ownership of DDR processes and programmes. Since the success of the DDR process depends largely on the reintegration of individuals at the community level, it is im- portant to ensure that capacity development efforts are not restricted to assisting national authorities, but include direct support to communities in areas of reintegration. In particular, international agencies can help to build local capacities for participation in assessment and planning processes, project and financial management, reporting, and evaluation.",

Normal parallel funding mechanisms include the following: \\n Mission financing: Although the UN peacekeeping mission is a key component of the overall UN integrated structure for DDR, its main funding mechanism (assessed contri- butions) is managed directly by the mission itself in coordination with DPKO Head- quarters, and cannot be integrated fully into the DDR funding structure. For this reason, it should be considered a parallel funding mechanism, even though the DDR funding structure decides how funds are used and managed; \\n Parallel agency funds: Certain agencies might have programmes that could support DDR activities (e.g., food assistance for ex-combatants as part of a broader food assistance programme), or even DDR projects that fall outside the overall integrated programme framework; \\n Bilateral assistance funds: Some donors, particularly those whose bilateral aid agencies are active on post-conflict and/or DDR issues (such as USAID, DFID, CIDA, etc.) might choose to finance programmes that are parallel to integrated efforts, and which are directly implemented by national or sub-national partners. In this context, it is important to ensure that these donors are active participants in DDR and the funding structures involved, and to ensure adequate operational coordination (particularly to ensure that the intended geographic areas and beneficiaries are covered by the programme).",
