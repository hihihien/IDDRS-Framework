In a peacekeeping context, this trend has been part of a move towards complex operations that seek to deal with a wide variety of issues ranging from security to human rights, rule of law, elections and economic governance, rather than traditional peacekeeping where two warring parties were separated by a ceasefire line patrolled by blue-helmeted soldiers.",

The definition includes girls recruited for sexual purposes and for forced marriage. It does not, therefore, only refer to a child who is carrying or has carried arms.”\\nIn his February 2000 report to the UN Security Council, the SecretaryGeneral defined a child soldier “as any person under the age 18 years of age who forms part of an armed force in any capacity and those accompanying such groups, other than purely as family members, as well as girls recruited for sexual purposes and forced marriage”. The CRC specifies that a child is every human below the age of 18.\\nThe term ‘children associated with armed forces and groups’, although more cumbersome, is now used to avoid the perception that the only children of concern are combatant boys. It points out that children eligible for release and reintegration programmes are both those associated with armed forces and groups and those who fled armed forces and groups (often considered as deserters and therefore requiring support and protection), children who were abducted, those forcibly married and those in detention.\\nAccess to demobilization does not depend on a child’s level of involvement in armed forces and groups. No distinction is made between combatants and non-combatants for fear of unfair treatment, oversight or exclusion (mainly of girls). Nevertheless, the child’s personal history and activities in the armed conflict can help decide on the kind of support he/she needs in the reintegration phase.",

Gender is part of the broader sociocultural context. Other important criteria for sociocultural analysis include class, race, poverty level, ethnic group and age. The concept of gender also includes the expectations held about the characteristics, aptitudes and likely behaviours of both women and men (femininity and masculinity). The concept of gender is vital, because, when it is applied to social analysis, it reveals how women’s subordination (or men’s domination) is socially constructed. As such, the subordination can be changed or ended. It is not biologically predetermined, nor is it fixed forever. As with any group, interactions among armed forces and groups, members’ roles and responsibilities within the group, and interactions between members of armed forces/groups and policy and decision makers are all heavily influenced by prevailing gender roles and gender relations in society.

It can consist of taking cultural traditions and values into consideration, depending on where the DDR process is taking place. For ex-combatants, their dependants and surrounding communities who are being sensitized, it means being prepared for and made aware of what will happen to them and their communities after being disarmed and demobilized, e.g., taking on new livelihoods, which will change both their lifestyle and environment.

There remains a real danger that violence will flare up again during the immediate post-conflict period, because putting right the political, security, social and economic problems and other root causes of war is a long-term project. Furthermore, peace operations are often mandated in contexts where an agreement is yet to be reached or where a peace process is yet to be initiated or is only partially initiated. In non-mission contexts, requests from the Government for the UN to support DDR are made either when ceasefires are reached or when a peace agreement or a comprehensive peace agreement is signed. This is why practitioners should decide whether DDR programmes, DDR-related tools and/or reintegration support constitute the most appropriate response to a particular situation. A DDR programme will only be appropriate when the preconditions referred to above are in place.",

Trust and commitment by the parties to the implementation of an agreement and minimum conditions of security are essential for the success of a DDR programme.

Both may require the full registration of weapons and personnel, followed by the collection of information, referral and counselling that are needed before effective reintegration programmes can be put in place. \\nThe rightsizing of armed forces or police: Governments may request assistance to downsize or restructure their armies or police and supporting institutional infrastructure (salaries, benefits, basic services, etc.). Such processes contribute to security sector reform (SSR) (see IDDRS 6.10 on DDR and Security Sector Reform). DDR practitioners should work in close collaboration with SSR experts while planning reintegration support to former members of armed forces. \\nThe repatriation of foreign combatants and associated groups: Considering the regional dimensions of conflict, Governments may agree to assistance to repatriation. DDR programmes may need to become involved in repatriating national combatants and their civilian family members, as well as children associated with armed forces and groups who may have crossed an international border. Such repatriation needs to be in accordance with the principle of non-refoulement, as set out in international humanitarian, human rights and refugee law (see IDDRS 2.11 on The Legal Framework for UN DDR).",

The importance of planning and initiating reinsertion and reintegration support activities at the start of a DDR programme has become increasingly evident, so adequate financing for reintegration needs to be secured in advance. This should help to prevent delays or gaps in implementation that could threaten or undermine the programme’s credibility and viability (see IDDRS 3.41 on Finance and Budgeting).",

Peace agreements can take a variety of forms, ranging from local-level agreements to national-level ceasefires and Comprehensive Peace Agreements (see IDDRS 2.20 on The Politics of DDR). Following the conclusion of an agreement, a DDR policy document may also be developed by the Government and the signatory armed groups, often with UN support.

In addition to these principles, the following general guiding principles related specifically to the legal framework apply when carrying out DDR processes. \\n Abide by the applicable legal framework. The applicable legal framework should be a core consideration at all stages, when drafting, designing, executing and evaluating DDR processes. Failure to abide by the applicable legal framework may result in consequences for the UN entity involved and the UN more generally, including possible liabilities. It may also lead to personal accountability for the DDR practitioner(s) involved. \\n Know your mandate. DDR practitioners should be familiar with the source and scope of their mandate. To the extent that their involvement in the DDR process requires coordination and/or cooperation with other UN system actors, they should also know the respective roles and responsibilities of those other actors. If a peace agreement exists, it should be one of the first documents that DDR practitioners consult to understand the framework in which they will carry out the DDR process. \\n Develop a concept of operations (CONOPS). DDR practitioners should have a common, agreed approach in order to ensure coherence amongst UN system-supported DDR processes and coordination among the various UN system actors that are conducting DDR in a particular context. This can be achieved through a written CONOPS, developed in consultation, as necessary, with the relevant headquarters. The CONOPS can also be adjusted to include the legal obligations of the UN system actor. \\n Develop operation-specific standard operating procedures (SOPs) or guidelines for DDR. Consistent with the CONOPS, DDR practitioners should consider developing operation-specific SOPs or guidelines. These may address, for instance, standards for cooperation with criminal justice and other accountability processes, measures for controlling access to DDR encampments or other installations, measures for the safe handling and destruction of weapons and ammunition, and other relevant issues. They may also include references to, and explanations of, the applicable legal standards. \\n Include legal considerations in all relevant project documents. In general, legal considerations should be integrated and addressed, as appropriate, in all relevant written project documents, including those agreed with the host State. \\n Seek legal advice. As a general matter, DDR practitioners should seek legal advice when they are in doubt as to whether a situation raises legal concerns. In particular, DDR practitioners should seek advice when they foresee new elements or significant changes in their DDR processes (e.g., when a new type of activity or new partners are involved). It is important to know where, and how, such advice may be requested and obtained. Familiarity with the legal office in-country and having clear channels of communication for seeking expeditious advice from headquarters are critical.",

States parties agree to take all appropriate measures, including legislation and temporary special measures, so that women can enjoy all their human rights and fundamental freedoms. General recommendation No. 30 on women in conflict prevention, conflict and post-conflict situations, issued by the CEDAW Committee in 2013, specifically recommends that States parties, among others, ensure (a) women’s participation in all stages of DDR processes; (b) that DDR processes specifically target female combatants and women and girls associated with armed groups and that barriers to their equitable participation are addressed; (c) that mental health and psychosocial support as well as other support services are provided to them; and (d) that DDR processes specifically address women’s distinct needs in order to provide age and gender-specific DDR support. \\n The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (2006) (CRPD) clarifies and qualifies how all categories of rights apply to persons with disabilities and identifies areas where adaptations have to be made for persons with disabilities to effectively exercise their rights, and where protection of rights must be reinforced. This is also relevant for people with psychosocial, intellectual and cognitive disabilities, and is a key legislative framework addressing their human rights including the right to quality services and the right to community integration. \\n The International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance (2006) (ICPPED) establishes that enforced disappearances are prohibited under all circumstances, including in times of war or a threat of war, internal political instability or other public emergency.",

Analysis of armed forces and groups should include the following: \\n Leadership: Including associated political leaders or structures (see below) and other persons who may have influence over the warring parties. The analysis should take into account external actors, including possible foreign supporters but also exiled leaders or others who may have some control over armed groups. It should also consider how much control the leadership has over the combatants and to what extent the leadership is representative of its members. Both control and representativeness can change over time. \\n Internal group dynamics: Including the balance between an organization’s po- litical and military wings, interactions between prominent members or factions within an armed force or group and how they influence the behaviour of the or- ganization, internal conflict patterns and potential fragmentation, the presence of female fighters or women associated with armed forces and groups (WAAFG), gender norms in the group, and the existence and pervasiveness of sexual violence. \\n Associated political leaders and structures: Including whether warring parties have a separate political branch or are integrated politico-military movements and how this shapes their agenda. Are women involved in political structures, and if so to what extent? Armed groups with separate political structures or a history of political engagement prior to the conflict have sometimes been more successful at transforming themselves into political parties, although this potential may erode during a prolonged conflict. \\n Associated religious leaders: Are religious leaders or personalities associated with the armed groups? What role could they play in peace negotiations? Do they have influence on the warring parties, and how can they help to shape the outcome of peace efforts? \\n Linkages with their base: Is a given armed group close to a political base or a popu- lation, and how do these linkages influence the group? Has this support been weak- ened by the use of certain tactics or actions (e.g., mass atrocities), or will repression of its base influence the armed group? Will efforts to demobilize combatants affect the armed group’s relations with its base or otherwise push it to change tactics – for instance eschewing violence so as to mobilize a political base that would otherwise reject violence. \\n Linkages with local, national and regional elites: Including influential indi- viduals or groups who hold sway over the armed forces and groups. These could include business people or communities, religious or traditional leaders or insti- tutions such as trade unions or cultural groupings. The diaspora may also be an important actor, providing political and economic support to communities and/or armed groups. \\n External support: Are there regional and/or broader international actors or net- works that provide political and financial support to armed groups, including on the basis of geopolitical interests? This might include State sponsors, diaspora or political exiles, transnational criminal networks or ideological affiliation and ‘franchising’ with foreign, often extremist, armed groups.",

            "Paragraph": "The way a conflict ends can influence the political dynamics of DDR. The following scenarios should be considered: \\n A clear victor: This usually results in a ‘victor’s peace’, where the winner can ‘im- pose’ demands on the party that lost the conflict. This may mean that the armed structures of the victor are preserved, while the losing party will be the one tar- geted for DDR. Less emphasis may be placed on the reintegration of the defeated combatants, and the stigma of being an ex-combatant or person formerly associated with an armed force or group (including children associated with armed forces and groups [CAAFG] and WAAFG) is compounded by that of having been a part of a defeated group, resulting in increased marginalization, exclusion and discrim- ination. The victorious group may seek to dominate the new security structures. \\n A negotiated process: At the national level, this is the most common form of con- flict resolution and often results in a comprehensive peace agreement (CPA) that addresses the political aspects of a conflict and might include provisions for DDR (this is considered a prerequisite for a DDR programme). Negotiated processes can also lead to local-level peace agreements, which can be followed by DDR- related tools such as CVR and transitional weapons and ammunition management (WAM) or reintegration support. DDR processes that are the outcome of negotiations (whether local or national) are more likely to be acceptable to warring parties. However, unless expert advice is provided, the DDR-related clauses in such agree- ments can be unrealistic. \\n Partial peace: In some conflicts the multiplicity of armed groups may result in peace processes that are not fully inclusive, since some of the armed groups are excluded from or refuse to sign the agreement. This can be a disincentive for signatory armed groups to disarm and demobilize due to fear for their security and that of the population they represent, concerns over loss of territory to a non- signatory armed group or uncertainty about how their political position might be affected should other armed groups eventually join the peace process.",

Local agendas – at the level of the individual, family, clan, municipality, community, district or ethnic group – can at least partly drive the continuation of violence. Some incidents of localized violence, such as clashes between rivals over positions of tradi- tional authority between two clans, will require primarily local solutions. However, other types of localized armed conflict may be intrinsically linked to the national level, and more amenable to top-down intervention. An example would be competition over political roles at the subfederal or district level. Experience shows that international interventions often neglect local mediation and conflict resolution, focusing instead on national-level cleavages. However, in many instances a combination of local and national conflict or dispute resolution mechanisms, including traditional ones, may be required. For these reasons, local political dynamics should be assessed.",

Another common underlying expectation is that CVR projects will contribute to social cohesion. In socially cohesive communities, com- munity members feel that they belong to the community, that there is trust between community members, and that community members can work together. Members of socially cohesive communities are more likely to be aware of, and more likely to inter- vene when they see, behaviour that may lead to violence.

If reintegration support is delayed, CVR can serve as a stop-gap measure, providing temporary reinsertion assistance for a defined period (6–18 months) (also see IDDRS 4.20 on Demobilization). \\n Members of armed groups who are not formally eligible for a DDR programme because their group is not signatory to a peace agreement. These groups may include rebel factions, paramilitaries, militia groups, members of armed gangs or other entities that are not part of a peace agreement. This category may include individuals who voluntarily leave active armed groups, including those that are designated as terrorist organizations by the United Nations Security Council (see IDDRS 2.11 on The Legal Framework for UN DDR). The status of these individuals and armed groups must be analysed and specified to mitigate any risks associated with their inclusion in CVR programmes. \\n Individuals who are not members of an armed group, but who are at risk of re- cruitment by such groups. These individuals are not part of an established armed group and are therefore ineligible to participate in a DDR programme. They do, however, exhibit the potential to build peace and to contribute to the prevention of recruitment in their community. This wide category of beneficiaries can include male and female children and youth (see IDDRS 5.20 on Children and DDR and 5.30 on Youth and DDR). \\n Designated communities that are susceptible to outbreaks of violence, close to cantonment sites, or likely to receive former combatants. In some cases, CVR may target communities and neighbourhoods that are situated close to cantonment sites and/or vulnerable to high rates of political violence, organized crime, or sex- ual or gender-based violence.

In non-mission settings, funding for CVR and reintegration support will depend on the allocation of national budgets and/or voluntary contributions from donors. Therefore, in instances where CVR and support to communi- ty-based reintegration are both envisaged in a non-mission setting, they should, from the outset, be planned and implemented as a single and continuous programme.

Although the return of a weapon is not typically a condition of partic- ipation in CVR, voluntary returns may demonstrate the willingness of beneficiaries to engage. Moreover, the removal and/or safe storage of weapons from individuals’ or armed groups’ inventories may help reduce open carrying and home possession of weaponry – factors that can contribute to violent exchanges and unintentional injuries. Even when weapons are not handed over as part of a CVR programme, it is beneficial to collect information on the weapons still in possession of those participating in CVR. This is because weapons in circulation will continue to represent a risk factor and have the potential to facilitate violence.

The twin UN resolutions on the 2015 peacebuilding architecture review, General Assembly resolution 70/262 and Security Council resolution 2282, recognize that efforts to sustain peace are necessary at all stages of conflict. This renewed UN policy engagement emerges from the need to address ongoing armed conflicts that are often protracted and complex.

It is also important to strengthen what still works, including the residual capacities for peace that people and communities draw on in times of conflict.

These negative patterns may also serve to increase vulnerability to involvement in armed groups and other criminal behaviour. The specific needs of women and girls formerly associated with armed forces and groups also need to be addressed, including preventing and addressing sexual and gender-based violence.",

As a result, reintegration support may only play an effective role in conflict prevention when these needs are acknowledged and addressed comprehensively. Thus, reintegration programmes can help to prevent conflict only when they account for: \\n The motivations of individuals to engage in and leave armed groups; \\n The criminogenic, or crime-inducing, risks present in the context that may impede sustained reintegration and increase vulnerability to involvement in armed groups and other criminal behaviour; \\n Local needs and existing capacities; \\n The strengthened resilience of individuals, families, communities and institutions to cope with adversity and to withstand violence and conflict-related pressures.",

Planning for DDR in contexts with weak or non-existent national institutions will differ greatly from planning DDR in contexts with stable and effective national institutions; \\n The role of the UN: How the role of the UN is defined in general terms, and for DDR specifically, will depend on the extent of responsibility and direct involvement assumed by national actors, and the UN’s own capacity to complement and support these efforts. This role definition will directly influence the scope and nature of the UN’s engagement in DDR, and hence requirements for planning; \\n Interaction with other international and regional actors: The presence and need to collaborate with international or regional actors (e.g., the European Union, NATO, the African Union, the Economic Community of West African States) with a current or potential role in the management of the conflict will affect the general planning process.",

DDR planning takes place within this broader integrated mission planning process; \\n Integration: The integrated approach to planning tries to develop, to the extent possible: \\n\\n a common framework (i.e., one that everyone involved uses) for developing, man- aging, funding and implementing a UN DDR strategy within the context of a peace mission; \\n\\n an integrated DDR management structure (unit or section), with the participation of staff from participating UN agencies and primary reporting lines to the Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General (DSRSG) for humanitarian and development affairs. Such an approach should include the co-location of staff, infrastructure and resources, as this allows for increased efficiency and reduced overhead costs, and brings about more responsive planning, implementation and coordination; \\n\\n joint programmes that harness UN country team and mission resources into a single process and results-based approach to putting the DDR strategy into operation and achieving shared objectives; \\n\\n a single framework for managing multiple sources of funding, as well as for co- ordinating funding mechanisms, thus ensuring that resources are used to deal with common priorities and needs; Efficient and effective planning: At the planning stage, a common DDR strategy and work plan should be developed on the basis of joint assessments and evaluation. This should establish a set of operational objectives, activities and expected results that all UN entities involved in DDR will use as the basis for their programming and implemen- tation activities. A common resource mobilization strategy involving all participating UN entities should be established within the integrated DDR framework in order to prevent duplication, and ensure coordination with donors and national authorities, and coherent and efficient planning.",

It is therefore essential that the departure of the peacekeeping mission is planned with the UN country team as early as possible to ensure that capacities are sufficiently built up in the country team for it to assume the full financial, logistic and human resources responsibilities for the continuation of the longer-term aspects of the DDR programme. A second essential requirement is the building of national capacities to assume full responsibility for the DDR programme, which should begin from the start of the DDR programme.",

The scope and depth of this detailed field assessment will depend on the amount of information gathered in previous assessments, such as the technical assessment mission. The current political and military situation in the country concerned and the amount of access possible to areas where combatants are located should also be carefully considered; \\n Thematic areas of focus: The detailed field assessment should deepen understanding, analysis and assessments conducted in the pre­mission period. It therefore builds on information gathered on the following thematic areas: \\n\\n political, social and economic context and background; \\n\\n causes, dynamics and consequences of the armed conflict; \\n\\n identification of specific groups, potential partners and others involved in the discussion process; \\n\\n distribution, availability and proliferation of weapons (primarily small arms and light weapons); \\n\\n institutional capacities of national stakeholders in areas related to DDR; \\n\\n survey of socio­economic conditions and local capacities to absorb ex­combatants and their dependants; \\n\\n preconditions and other factors that will influence DDR; \\n\\n baseline data and performance indicators for programme design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation. \\n\\n (Also see Annex B of IDDRS 3.10 on Integrated DDR Planning: Processes and Structures.); \\n Expertise: The next step is to identify the DDR expertise required. Assessment teams should be composed of specialists in all aspects of DDR (see IDDRS Level 5 for more information on the different needs that have to be met during a DDR mission). To ensure coherence with the political process and overall objectives of the peacekeeping mandate, the assessment should be led by a member of the UN DDR unit; \\n Local participation: Where the political situation allows, national and local participation in the assessment should be emphasized to ensure that local analyses of the situation, the needs and appropriate solutions are reflected and included in the DDR pro­ gramme. There is a need, however, to be aware of local bias, especially in the tense immediate post­conflict environment; \\n Building confidence and managing expectations: Where possible, detailed field assessments should be linked with preparatory assistance projects and initiatives (e.g., community development programmes and quick­impact projects) to build confidence in and support for the DDR programme. Care must be taken, however, not to raise unrealistic expec­ tations of the DDR programme; \\n Design of the field assessment: Before starting the assessment, DDR practitioners should: \\n\\n identify the research objectives and indicators (what are we assessing?); \\n\\n identify the sources and methods for data collection (where are we going to obtain our information?); \\n\\n develop appropriate analytical tools and techniques (how are we going to make sense of our data?); \\n\\n develop a method for interpreting the findings in a practical way (how are we going to apply the results?); \\n Being flexible: Thinking about and answering these questions are essential to developing a well­designed approach and work plan that allows for a systematic and well­structured data collection process. Naturally, the approach will change once data collection begins in the field, but this should not in any way reduce its importance as an initial guiding blueprint.",

Given the large geographical areas in which DDR assessments are carried out, estimating and extrapolating based on a representative sample is the only way to obtain an idea of the ‘bigger picture’; \\n Triangulation (cross­referencing), or the comparison of results from three different methods or data sources, helps to confirm the validity of data collected in contexts where infor­mation is fragmentary, imprecise or unreliable. Although normally used with direct observation and interviewing (where facts are confirmed by using three or more differ­ ent sources), triangulation can also be applied between different methods, to increase the probability of reaching a reasonably accurate result, and to maximize reliability and validity; \\n Geographic/Demographic mapping, which draws on all the techniques mentioned above, involves plotting the information gained about participants and beneficiaries geo­ graphically (i.e., the way they are spread over a geographical area) or chronologically (over time) to determine their concentration, spread and any changes over time.",

These provide a strategic framework for organizing and anchoring relevant activities and outputs; \\n Baseline data: For each specific objective, the initial starting point should be briefly described. In the absence of hard quantitative baseline data, give a qualitative descrip­ tion of the current situation. Defining the baseline is a critical part of monitoring and evaluating the performance and impact of programmes; \\n Indicative activities: For each objective, a list of indicative activities should be provided in order to give a sense of the range and kind of activities that need to be implemented so as to achieve the expected outputs and objectives. For the general results frame­ work, these do not need to be complete or highly detailed, but they must be sufficient to provide a sense of the underlying strategy, scope and range of actions that will be implemented; \\n Intervals: Activities and priority outputs should be have precise time­lines (preferably specific dates). For each of these dates, indicate the expected level of result that should be achieved. This should allow an overview of how each relevant component of the programme is expected to progress over time and what has to be achieved by what date; \\n Targets and monitoring indicators: For each activity there should be an observable target, objectively verifiable and useful as a monitoring indicator. These indicators will vary depending on the activity, and they do not always have to be quantitative. For example, ‘reduction in perceptions of violence’ is as useful as ‘15 percent of ex­combatants success­ fully reintegrated’; \\n Inputs: For each activity or output there should be an indication of inputs and their costs. General cost categories should be used to identify the essential requirements, which can include staff, infrastructure, equipment, operating expenses, service contracts, grants, consultancies, etc.",

Taken together, these will affect the degree to which a given government can take effective ownership of and responsibility for DDR; \\n Technical capacities and knowledge: Even when post-conflict governments are legitimate and capable, they may lack the specific technical knowledge that is needed to link DDR to a national reconstruction plan and SSR; \\n Participation of civil society: In many post-conflict situations, civil society may have been repressed or marginalized and lack access to political decision-making processes. The representation of civil society at all levels in the body politic is essential, and the UN should support the participation and engagement of civil society in DDR processes wherever possible. Possible roles may include involvement in the policy development process (and particularly its link with transitional justice and equity issues); assistance with the identification of people associated with armed groups and forces, especially women and children; and implementing (particularly focusing on the involvement of local communities) and monitoring the effectiveness of DDR programmes.",

            "Paragraph": "UN support to national efforts take place in the following areas (the actual degree of UN engagement should be determined on the basis of the considerations outlined above): \\n Political/Strategic support: In order for the international community to provide political support to the DDR process, it is essential to understand the dynamics of both the conflict and the post-conflict period. By carrying out a stakeholder analysis (as part of a larger conflict assessment process), it will be possible to better understand the dynam- ics among national actors, and to identify DDR supporters and potential spoilers; \\n Institutional capacity development: It is important that capacity development strategies are established jointly with national authorities at the start of international involvement in DDR to ensure that the parties themselves take ownership of and responsibility for the success of the process. The UN system should play an important role in supporting the development of national and local capacities for DDR through providing technical assistance, establishing partnership arrangements with national institutions, and pro- viding training and capacity-building to local implementing partners; \\n Support for the establishment of legal frameworks: A key area in which international exper- tise can support the development of national capacities is in the drawing up of legal frameworks for DDR and related processes of SSR and weapons management. The UN system should draw on experiences from a range of political and legal systems, and assist national authorities in drafting appropriate legislation and legal instruments; \\n Technical assistance for policy and planning: Through the provision of technical assistance, the UN system should provide direct support to the development of national DDR policy and programmes. It is important to ensure, however, that this assistance is provided through partnership or mentoring arrangements that allow for knowledge and skills transfers to national staff, and to avoid situations where international experts take direct responsibility for programme functions within national institutions. When several international institutions are providing technical assistance to national authori- ties, it is important to ensure that this assistance is coordinated and coherent; \\n Direct support for implementation and financial management: The UN system may also be called upon, either by Security Council mandate or at the request of national authorities, to provide direct support for the implementation of certain components of a DDR pro- gramme, including the financial management of resources for DDR. A memorandum of understanding should be established between the UN and national authorities that defines the precise area of responsibility for programme delivery, mechanisms for co- ordination with local partners and clear reporting responsibilities; \\n Material/Logistic support: In the post-conflict period, many national institutions lack both material and human resources. The UN system should provide material and logistic support to national DDR institutions and implementing agencies, particularly in the areas of: information and communications technology and equipment; transportation; rehabilitation, design and management of DDR sites, transit centres and other facilities; the establishment of information management and referral systems; and the procurement of basic goods for reinsertion kits, among others (also see IDDRS 4.10 on Disarmament, IDDRS 4.20 on Demobilization and IDDRS 4.30 on Social and Economic Reintegration); \\n Training programmes for national staff: The UN system should further support capacity development through the provision of training. There are a number of different training methodologies, including the provision of courses or seminars, training of trainers, on- the-job or continuous training, and exchanges with experts from other national DDR institutions. Although shortage of time and money may limit the training options that can be offered, it is important that the approach chosen builds skills through a continuous process of capacity development that transfers skills to local actors; \\n Support to local capacity development and community empowerment: Through local capacity development and community empowerment, the UN system should support local ownership of DDR processes and programmes. Since the success of the DDR process depends largely on the reintegration of individuals at the community level, it is im- portant to ensure that capacity development efforts are not restricted to assisting national authorities, but include direct support to communities in areas of reintegration. In particular, international agencies can help to build local capacities for participation in assessment and planning processes, project and financial management, reporting, and evaluation.",

Normal parallel funding mechanisms include the following: \\n Mission financing: Although the UN peacekeeping mission is a key component of the overall UN integrated structure for DDR, its main funding mechanism (assessed contri- butions) is managed directly by the mission itself in coordination with DPKO Head- quarters, and cannot be integrated fully into the DDR funding structure. For this reason, it should be considered a parallel funding mechanism, even though the DDR funding structure decides how funds are used and managed; \\n Parallel agency funds: Certain agencies might have programmes that could support DDR activities (e.g., food assistance for ex-combatants as part of a broader food assistance programme), or even DDR projects that fall outside the overall integrated programme framework; \\n Bilateral assistance funds: Some donors, particularly those whose bilateral aid agencies are active on post-conflict and/or DDR issues (such as USAID, DFID, CIDA, etc.) might choose to finance programmes that are parallel to integrated efforts, and which are directly implemented by national or sub-national partners. In this context, it is important to ensure that these donors are active participants in DDR and the funding structures involved, and to ensure adequate operational coordination (particularly to ensure that the intended geographic areas and beneficiaries are covered by the programme).",

Seconded personnel from UN agencies, funds and programmes will work in this section to contribute to the joint planning and coordination of the DDR programme. Attached military and police per­ sonnel from within the mission will also form part of this component; \\n Disarmament and demobilization: This component will be responsible for the overall implementation and management of all aspects of the disarmament and demobilization phases of the DDR programme. This includes short­term disarmament activities, such as weapons collection and registration, but also longer­term disarmament activities that support the establishment of a legal regime for the control of small arms and light weapons, and other community weapons collection initiatives. Where mandated, this component will coordinate with the military to assist in the destruction of weapons, ammunition and unexploded ordnance; \\n Reintegration: This component plans the economic and social reintegration strategies. It also plans the reinsertion programme to ensure consistency and coherence with the overall reintegration strategy. It needs to work closely with other parts of the mission facilitating the return and reintegration of internally displaced persons (IDPs) and refugees; \\n Monitoring and evaluation: This component is responsible for setting up and monitoring indicators to measure the achievements in all phases of the DDR programme. It also conducts DDR­related surveys such as small arms baseline surveys, profiling of parti­ cipants and beneficiaries, mapping of economic opportunities, etc.; \\n Public information and sensitization: This component works to develop the public informa­ tion and sensitization strategy for the DDR programme. It draws on the direct support of the public information unit in the peacekeeping mission, but also employs other information dissemination personnel within the mission, such as the military, police and civil affairs officers, as well as local mechanisms such as theatre groups, adminis­ trative structures, etc.; \\n Administrative and financial management: This is a small component of the unit, which may be seconded from an integrating UN entity to support the programme delivery aspect of the DDR unit. Its role is to utilize the administrative and financial capacities of the UN country office; \\n Regional DDR offices: These are the regional implementing components of the DDR unit, which would implement programmes at the local level in close cooperation with the other regionalized components of civil affairs, military, police, etc.",

For the time being, the following principles shall guide the establishment of the integrated DDR unit: \\n Joint management of the DDR unit: The chief of the DDR unit shall come from the peace­ keeping mission. His/Her post shall be funded from the peacekeeping assessed budget. The deputy chief of the integrated DDR unit shall be seconded from UNDP, although the peacekeeping mission will provide him/her with administrative and logistic support for him/her to perform his/her function as deputy chief of the DDR unit. Such integration allows the DDR unit to use the particular skills of both the mission and the country office, maximizing existing local knowledge and ensuring a smooth transition on DDR­related issues when the mandate of the peacekeeping mission ends; \\n Administrative and finance cell from UNDP: UNDP shall second a small administrative and finance cell from its country office to support the programme delivery aspects of the DDR component. The principles of secondment use for the deputy chief of the DDR unit shall apply; \\n Secondment of staff from other UN entities: In order to maximize coherence and coordina­ tion on DDR between missions and UN agencies, staff members from other agencies may be seconded to specific posts in the integrated DDR unit. Use of this method ensures the active engagement and participation of UN agencies in strategic policy decisions and coordination of UN DDR activities (including both mission operational support and programme implementation). The integration and co­location of UN agency staff in this structure are essential, given the complex and highly operational nature of DDR. Decisions on secondment shall be made at the earliest stages of planning to ensure that the proper budgetary support is secure to support the integrated DDR unit and the seconded personnel; \\n Project support units: Core UN agency staff seconded to the integrated DDR unit may be complemented by additional project support staff located in project support units (PSUs) in order to provide capacity (programme, monitoring, operations, finance) for implementing key elements of UN assistance within the national planning and pro­ gramme framework for DDR. The PSU will also be responsible for ensuring links and coordination with other agency programme areas (particularly in rule of law and security sector reform). Additional PSUs managed by other UN agencies can also be established, depending on the implementation/operational role attributed to them; \\n Links with other parts of the peacekeeping mission: The integrated DDR unit shall be closely linked with other parts of the peacekeeping mission, in particular the military and the police, to ensure a ‘joined­up’ approach to the DDR programme.",

In order for indicators to be meaningful, measurement must be made against a baseline, or baseline data, both of which are collected either in the context of the pre­programme comprehensive assessment or during programme implementation. In general, most indicators should be developed together with the definition of programme activities, outputs, outcomes, objectives and goals. In general, indicators can be classified as follows: \\n Performance indicator: A particular characteristic or dimension used to measure intended changes defined by a programme results framework. Performance indicators are used to observe progress and to measure actual outputs and outcomes compared to those that were expected. They indicate ‘how, ‘whether’ or ‘to what extent’ a unit is pro­ gressing towards its objectives, rather than ‘why’ or ‘why not’ such progress is being made. Performance indicators are usually expressed in quantifiable terms, and should be objective and measurable (e.g., numeric values, percentages, scores and indices); \\n Impact indicator: A variable or set of variables used to measure the overall and long­ term impact of an intervention, i.e., overall changes in the environment that DDR aims to influence. Impact indicators often use a composite set (or group) of indicators, each of which provides information on the size, sustainability and consequences of a change brought about by a DDR intervention. Such indicators can include both quan­ titative variables (e.g., change in homicide levels or incidence of violence) or qualitative variables (e.g., behavioural change among reintegrated ex­combatants, social cohesion, etc.). Impact indicators depend on comprehensive and reliable baseline data, and should be as specific in possible in order to isolate the impact of DDR on complex social and economic dynamics from other factors and processes; \\n Proxy indicators: Cost, complexity and/or the timeliness of data collection may prevent a result from being measured directly. In this case, proxy indicators — which are variables that substitute for others that are difficult to measure directly — may reveal performance trends and make managers aware of potential problems or areas of success. This is often the case for outcomes in behavioural change, social cohesion and other results that are difficult to measure.",

If results indicate that implementation is ‘off course’, these results provide DDR management with infor­ mation on what corrective action needs to be taken in order to bring implementation back into conformity with the overall programme implementation strategy and work plan. These results are therefore an important management tool; \\n Revision of programme strategy: Monitoring results can also provide information on the relevance or effectiveness of an existing strategy or course of action to produce specific outcomes or achieve key objectives. In certain cases, such results can demonstrate that a given course of action is not producing the intended outcomes and can provide DDR managers with an opportunity to reformulate or revise specific implementation strategies and approaches, and make the corresponding changes to the programme work plan. Examples include types of reintegration assistance that are not viable or appro­ priate to the local context, and that can be corrected before many other ex­combatants enter similar schemes; \\n Use of resources: Monitoring results can provide important indications about the effi­ ciency with which resources are used to implement activities and achieve outcomes. Given the large scale and number of activities and sub­projects involved in DDR, overall cost­effectiveness is an essential element in ensuring that DDR programmes achieve their overall objectives. In this regard, accurate and timely monitoring can enable programme managers to develop more cost­effective or efficient uses and distri­ bution of resources.",

In general, the scope of an evaluation varies between evaluations that focus primarily on ‘impacts’ and those that focus on broader ‘outcomes’: \\n Outcome evaluations: These focus on examining how a set of related projects, programmes and strategies brought about an anticipated outcome. DDR programmes, for instance, contribute to the consolidation of peace and security, but they are not the sole pro­ gramme or factor that explains progress in achieving (or not achieving) this outcome, owing to the role of other programmes (SSR, police training, peace­building activities, etc.). Outcome evaluations define the specific contribution made by DDR to achieving this goal, or explain how DDR programmes interrelated with other processes to achieve the outcome. In this regard, outcome evaluations are primarily designed for broad comparative or strategic policy purposes. Example of an objective: “to contribute to the consolidation of peace, national security, reconciliation and development through the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of ex­combatants into civil society”; \\n Impact evaluations: These focus on the overall, longer­term impact, whether intended or unintended, of a programme. Impact evaluations can focus on the direct impacts of a DDR programme — e.g., its ability to successfully demobilize entire armies and decrease the potential for a return to conflict — and its indirect impact in helping to increase economic productivity at the local level, or in attracting ex­combatants from neighbouring countries where other conflicts are occurring. An example of an objective of a DDR programme is: “to facilitate the development and environment in which ex­ combatants are able to be disarmed, demobilized and reintegrated into their communities of choice and have access to social and economic reintegration opportunities”.",

            "Paragraph": "In general, evaluations should be carried out at key points in the programme implementation cycle in order to achieve related yet distinct objectives. Four main categories or types of evaluations can be identified: \\n Formative internal evaluations are primarily conducted in the early phase of programme implementation in order to assess early hypotheses and working assumptions, analyse outcomes from pilot interventions and activities, or verify the viability or relevance of a strategy or set of intended outputs. Such evaluations are valuable mechanisms that allow implementation strategies to be corrected early on in the programme implemen­ tation process by identifying potential problems. This type of evaluation is particularly important for DDR processes, given their complex strategic arrangements and the many different sub­processes involved. Most formative internal evaluations can be carried out internally by the M&E officer or unit within a DDR section; \\n Mid-term evaluations are similar to formative internal evaluations, but are usually more comprehensive and strategic in their scope and focus, as opposed to the more diag­ nostic function of the formative type. Mid­term evaluations are usually intended to provide an assessment of the performance and outcomes of a DDR process for stake­ holders, partners and donors, and to enable policy makers to assess the overall role of DDR in the broader post­conflict context. Mid­term evaluations can also include early assessments of the overall contribution of a DDR process to achieving broader post­ conflict goals; \\n Terminal evaluations are usually carried out at the end of the programme cycle, and are designed to evaluate the overall outcomes and effectiveness of a DDR strategy and programme, the degree to which their main aims were achieved, and their overall effec­ tiveness in contributing to broader goals. Terminal evaluations usually also try to answer a number of key questions regarding the overall strategic approach and focus of the programme, mainly its relevance, efficiency, sustainability and effectiveness; \\n Ex-post evaluations are usually carried out some time (usually several years) after the end of a DDR programme in order to evaluate the long­term effectiveness of the programme, mainly the sustainability of its activities and positive outcomes (e.g., the extent to which ex­combatants remain productively engaged in alternatives to violence or mili­ tary activity) or its direct and indirect impacts on security conditions, prospects for peace­building, and consequences for economic productivity and development. Ex­post evaluations of DDR programmes can also form part of larger impact evaluations to assess the overall effectiveness of a post­conflict recovery strategy. Both terminal and ex­post evaluations are valuable mechanisms for identifying key lessons learned and best practice for further policy development and the design of future DDR programmes.",

A more meaningful approach is to identify the various types of impacts or issues to be analysed, and to construct composite (i.e., a group of) indi­ cators as part of an overall methodological approach to evaluating the programme. The following factors usually form the basis from which an evaluation’s focus is defined: \\n Relevance describes the extent to which the objectives of a programme or project remain valid and pertinent (relevant) as originally planned, or as modified owing to changing circumstances within the immediate context and external environment of that pro­ gramme or project. Relevance can also include the suitability of a particular strategy or approach for dealing with a specific problem or issue. A DDR­specific evaluation could focus on the relevance of cantonment­based demobilization strategies, for instance, in comparison with other approaches (e.g., decentralized registration of combatants) that perhaps could have more effectively achieved the same objectives; \\n Sustainability involves the success of a strategy in continuing to achieve its initial objec­ tives even after the end of a programme, i.e., whether it has a long­lasting effect. In a DDR programme, this is most important in determining the long­term viability and effectiveness of reintegration assistance and the extent to which it ensures that ex­ combatants remain in civilian life and do not return to military or violence­based livelihoods. Indicators in such a methodology include the viability of alternative eco­ nomic livelihoods, behavioural change among ex­combatants, and so forth; \\n Impact includes the immediate and long­term consequences of an intervention on the place in which it is implemented, and on the lives of those who are assisted or who benefit from the programme. Evaluating the impact of DDR includes focusing on the immediate social and economic effects of the return of ex­combatants and their inte­ gration into social and economic life, and the attitudes of communities and the specific direct or indirect effects of these on the lives of individuals; \\n Effectiveness measures the extent to which a programme has been successful in achieving its key objectives. The measurement of effectiveness can be quite specific (e.g., the success of a DDR programme in demobilizing and reintegrating the majority of ex­ combatants) or can be defined in broad or strategic terms (e.g., the extent to which a DDR programme has lowered political tensions, reduced levels of insecurity or improved the well­being of host communities); \\n Efficiency refers to how well a given DDR programme and strategy transformed inputs into results and outputs. This is a different way of focusing on the impact of a pro­ gramme, because it places more emphasis on how economically resources were used to achieve specific outcomes. In certain cases, a DDR programme might have been successful in demobilizing and reintegrating a significant number of ex­combatants, and improving the welfare of host communities, but used up a disproportionately large share of resources that could have been better used to assist other groups that were not covered by the programme. In such a case, a lack of programme efficiency limited the potential scope of its impact.",

This is particularly useful when programmes are designed to be implemented in phases, which allows for the assessment and identification of problems and best practice at the end of each phase, which can then be fed into later phases; \\n Evaluations also contribute to discussions between policy makers and practitioners on the further development of international and regional policies on DDR, by providing them with information and analyses that influence the way key policy issues can be dealt with and decisions reached.

Such an approach requires gender expertise, gender analysis, the collection of sex- and age-disaggregated data, and the meaningful participation of women and girls at each stage of the process. A gender- transformative approach actively examines, questions and changes unequal gender norms and imbalances of power. A gender-transformative approach thus helps countries to promote equitable rights and health, and contributes to the prevention of sexual and gender-based violence. A gender- transformative DDR programme should acknowledge, incorporate and address messages on masculinities and violence, including the linkage between masculinities and weapons ownership. Gender-transformative DDR programmes should also ensure that there are both male and female UN military personnel in leadership roles at pick-up points and mobile disarmament sites, and participating in the destruction of weapons.

Staff should be conscious not only of the risks associated with handling weapons, ammunition and explosives, but also of the risks of unpredictable behaviour as a result of the significant levels of stress that disarmament activities can generate among combatants and other stakeholders. \\n Avoid supporting weapons buy-back: UN supported DDR programmes shall avoid attaching monetary value to weapons as a means of encouraging their surrender by members of armed forces and groups. Weapons buy-back programmes within and outside DDR have proven to be inefficient and even counter-productive as they tend to fuel national and regional arms flows, which in the end can jeopardize the achievement of disarmament objectives in a DDR programme. Buy-back programmes can also have unintended societal consequences such as economically rewarding combatants and exacerbating existing gender inequalities \\n Disarmament of foreign combatants: Disarmament operations may also need to consider armed foreign combatants. Foreign combatants may be disarmed in the host country or at the border of the country of origin to which they will be returning. DDR programmes should plan for disarmament of foreign combatants within or outside repatriation agreements between the country of origin and the host country (see IDDRS 5.40 on Cross-Border Population Movements). \\n Terrorism and violent extremism threats: DDR programmes are increasingly being conducted in contexts affected by terrorism. Disarmament operations in these contexts require the highest security safeguards and robust on-site WAM expertise to maximize the safety of all involved. DDR practitioners should be aware of the requirements imposed on States by UN Security Council resolutions 2370 (2017) and 2482 (2019) and Council’s 2015 Madrid Guiding Principles and its 2018 Addendum, in terms of, inter alia, ensuring that appropriate legal actions are taken against those who knowingly engage in providing terrorists with weapons.4 \\n Lack of sustainability: Disarmament operations shall not start unless the sustainability of funding and resources is guaranteed. Previous attempts to carry out disarmament operations with insufficient assets and funds have resulted in unconstructive, partial disarmament, a return to armed conflict, and the failure of the entire DDR process. The reconfiguring and closing of UN missions is another crucial moment that should be planned in advance. Such transitions often require handing over responsibility to national authorities or to the United Nations Country Team (UNCT). It is important to ensure these entities have the mandate and capacity to complete the DDR programme even after the withdrawal of UN mission resources.",

            "Paragraph": "BOX 6: PROCESSING HEAVY WEAPONS AND THEIR AMMUNITION \\n An increasing number of armed groups in areas of conflict across the world use light and heavy weapons, including heavy artillery or armoured fighting vehicles. Dealing with heavy weapons presents both logistical and political challenges. In certain settings, heavy weapons could be included in the eligibility criteria for a DDR programme, and the ratio of arms to combatants could be determined based on the number of crew required to operate each specific weapons system. However, while small arms and most light weapons are generally seen as an individual asset, heavy weapons are often considered a group asset, and thus may not be surrendered during disarmament operations that focus on individual combatants and persons associated with armed forces and groups. \\n To ensure comprehensive disarmament and avoid the exploitation of loopholes, peace negotiations and the national DDR programme should determine the procedures related to the arsenals of armed groups, including heavy weapons and/or caches of materiel. Processing heavy weapons and their ammunition requires a high level of technical knowledge. Heavy-weapons systems can be complex and require specialist expertise to ensure that systems are made safe, unloaded and all items of ammunition are safely separated from the platform. Conducting a thorough weapons survey and planning is vital to ensure the correct expertise is made available. The UN DDR component in mission settings or UN lead agency(ies) in non-mission settings should provide advice with regards to the collection, storage and disposal of heavy weapons, and support the development of any related SOPs. Procedures regarding heavy weapons should be clearly communicated to armed forces and groups prior to any disarmament operations to avoid unorganized and unscheduled movements of heavy weapons that might foment further tensions among the population. Destruction of heavy weapons requires significant logistics (see section 8); it is therefore critical to ensure the physical security of these weapons in order to reduce the risk of diversion.",

By supporting better arms control and preventing the diversion of weapons, ammunition and explosives to unauthorized end users, transitional WAM can be a strong component of the sustaining peace approach and contribute to pre- venting the outbreak, escalation, continuation and recurrence of conflict (see IDDRS 2.40 on Reintegration as Part of Sustaining Peace).

Mediators and DDR practitioners supporting the mediation process should have strong DDR and WAM knowledge, or at least have access to expertise that can guide them in designing appropriate and evidence-based DDR-related transitional WAM provisions. Transitional WAM as part of CVR and pre-DDR can also enable relevant parties to engage more confidently in negotiations as they maintain ownership of and access to their materiel. Prolonged CVR and pre-DDR, however, can also become a support mechanism for armed groups rather than an incentive to finalize peace negotiations. Such processes should therefore be approached with caution (see IDDRS 2.20 on The Politics of DDR).",

Individuals leave armed forces and groups for many different reasons. Some become tired of life as a combatant, while others are sick or wounded and can no longer continue to fight. Some leave because they are disillusioned with the goals of the group, they see greater benefit in civilian life or they believe they have won. \\n In some circumstances, States also encourage this type of voluntary exit by offering safe pathways out of the group, either to push those who remain towards negotiated settlement or to deplete the military capacity of these groups in order to render them more vulnerable to defeat. These individuals might report to an amnesty commission or to State institutions that will formally recognize their transition to civilian status. Those who transition to civilian status in this way may be eligible to receive assistance through DDR-related tools such as community violence reduction initiatives and/or to be provided with reintegration support (see IDDRS 2.10 on The UN Approach to DDR). Transitional assistance (similar to reinsertion as part of a DDR programme) may also be provided to these individuals.

Locations and routes for medical and obstetric emergency referral must be identified, and there should be sufficient capacity for referral or medical evacuation to address any emergencies that may arise. Accessibility allowing national or international military forces to secure the site and for logistic and supply lines is extremely important. The effects of weather changes (e.g., the start of the rainy season) should be considered when assessing accessibility. \\n Security: Ex-combatants and persons formerly associated with armed forces and groups should feel and be safe in the selected location. When establishing sites, it is important to consider the general political and military environment, as well as how vulnerable DDR participants are to potential threats, including cross-border violence and retaliation by active armed forces and groups. The security of nearby communities must also be taken into account. \\n Local communities: DDR practitioners should adequately liaise with local leaders and national and international military forces to ensure that nearby communities are not adversely affected by the demobilization site or operation. \\n General amenities: Demobilization sites should be chosen with the following needs taken into account: potable water supply, washing and toilet facilities (separate facilities for men and women, with locks and lighting if they will be used after dark), drainage for rain and waste, flooding potential and the natural water course, local power and food supply, environmental hazards, pollution, infestation, cooking and eating facilities, lighting both for security and functionality, and, finally, facility space for recreation, including sports. Special arrangements/contingency plans should be made for children, persons with disabilities, persons with chronic illnesses, and pregnant or lactating women. \\n Storage facilities/armoury: If disarmament and demobilization are to take place at the same site, secure and guarded facilities/armouries for temporary storage of collected weapons shall be set up (see IDDRS 4.10 on Disarmament). \\n Communications infrastructure: The site should be located in an area suitable for radio and/or telecommunications infrastructure.",

Risks related to women, youth, children, dependants and other specific-needs groups should also be considered. In developing this ‘safe’ working environment, it must be acknowledged that there can be no absolute safety and that many of the activities carried out during demobilization operations have a high risk associated with them. However, national authorities, international organizations and non-governmental organizations must try to achieve the highest possible levels of safety. Risks during demobilization operations may include: \\n Attacks on demobilization site personnel: The personnel who staff demobilization sites may be targeted by armed groups that have not signed on to the peace agreement. \\n Attacks on demobilized individuals: In some instances, peace agreements may cause armed groups to fracture, with some parts of the group opting to enter DDR while others continue fighting. In these instances, those who favour continued armed conflict may retaliate against individuals who demobilize. In some cases, active armed groups may approach demobilization sites with the aim of retrieving their former members. If demobilized individuals have already returned home, members of active armed groups may attempt to track these individuals down in order to punish or forcibly re-recruit them. The family members of the demobilized may also be subject to threats and attacks, particularly if they reside in areas where members of their family member’s former group are still present. \\n Attacks on women and minority groups: Historically, SGBV against women and minority groups in cantonment sites has been high. It is essential that security and risk assessments take into consideration the specific vulnerabilities of women, identify minority groups who may also be at risk and provide additional security measures to ensure their safety. \\n Attacks on individuals transporting and receiving reinsertion support: Security risks are associated with the transportation of cash and commodities that can be easily seized by armed individuals. If it is known that demobilized individuals will receive cash and/or commodities at a certain time and/or place, it may make them targets for robbery. \\n Unrest and criminality: If armed groups remain in demobilization sites (particularly cantonment sites) for long periods of time, perhaps because of delays in the DDR programme, these sites may become places of unrest, especially if food and water become scarce. Demobilization delays can lead to mutinies by combatants and persons associated with armed forces and groups as they lose trust in the process. This is especially true if demobilizing individuals begin to feel that the State and/or international community is reneging on previous promises. In these circumstances, demobilized individuals may resort to criminality in nearby communities or mount protests against demobilization personnel. \\n Recruitment: Armed forces and groups may use the prospect of demobilization (and associated reinsertion benefits) as an incentive to recruit civilians.",

Verification can be conducted by representatives from the armed forces and groups undergoing demobilization; the UN and national authorities, such as the national DDR commission; or joint teams. Questions touching upon the location of specific battles and military bases and the names of senior group members should be asked. Without verification, military commanders may attempt to bring civilians into the DDR programme. They may also attempt to engage in recruitment just prior to the onset of DDR in order to provide benefits to followers of the group or to take a cut of the benefits being offered to these newly recruited individuals. Explicitly stating the maximum number of individuals who may participate in a peace agreement or DDR policy document can limit incentives for commanders to engage in recruitment. So too can a cut-off date for eligibility. Armed forces and groups often prepare lists of their members prior to the onset of a DDR programme. Whenever lists are prepared, DDR practitioners shall ensure that a verification mechanism is in place to ensure that those listed meet the required eligibility criteria. A mechanism should also be in place to resolve disputed cases and to deal with those who are excluded.

This system can be used to track when and where DDR benefits are disbursed and to whom (see section 6.8). The data recorded in the case management system should include a biometric component where possible. Biometric systems store the unique physical features – iris, face or fingerprint data – of individuals for future reference. Biometric registration serves mainly to ensure that DDR participants do not try to ‘game the system’ by going through the DDR programme more than once to receive multiple benefits. An advantage of all biometric systems is that, if properly implemented, they are completely confidential. A unique string of letters or numbers is assigned to a photograph or fingerprint, and the original photos or prints are then discarded. Different biometric systems have different levels of cost and user friendliness. Facial recognition systems are the most sophisticated but also the most expensive. DDR practitioners using this technology will require appropriate training. Alternatively, fingerprinting is an easy and cheap way to obtain biometric data. Fingerprints can be taken on smart phones or mobile fingerprint scanners, and training requirements are minimal. The context in which registration takes place should be taken into account when considering biometric registration. For example, if the armed conflict was tied to civic and national honour, peer control mechanisms may be sufficient to ensure that individuals do not try to ‘double dip’. However, in contexts marked by distrust between the warring parties, and combatants who move from one group or conflict to another, more careful biometric monitoring may be required. The biometric registration systems established for demobilization processes can also be linked to processes of security sector integration and reform (see IDDRS 6.10 on DDR and Security Sector Reform).",

Reintegration is essentially a social and economic process with an open timeframe, primarily taking place in communities at the local level. It is part of the general development of a country and a national responsibility, and often necessitates long-term external assistance.” \\n Recognizing new developments in the reintegration of ex-combatants and associated groups since the release of the 2005 Note, the Third Report of the Secretary-General on DDR (2011) includes revised policy and guidance. It observes that, “in most countries, economic aspects, while central, are not sufficient for the sustainable reintegration of ex-combatants. Serious consideration of the social and political aspects of reintegration…is [also] crucial for the sustainability and success of reintegration programmes,” including interventions, such as psychosocial support, mental health counseling and clinical treatment and medical health support, as well as reconciliation, access to justice/transitional justice, participation in political processes. \\n Additionally, it emphasizes that while “reintegration programmes supported by the United Nations are time-bound by nature…the reintegration of ex-combatants and associated groups is a long-term process that takes place at the indi- vidual, community, national and regional levels, and is dependent upon wider recovery and development.” \\n Note by the Secretary-General on administrative and budgetary aspects of the financing of UN peacekeeping operations, 24 May 2005 (A/C.5/59/31); Third report of the Secretary-General on Disarmament, demobilization and reintegration, 21 March 2011 (A/65/741)",

At the end of a conflict there is often an abrupt release into the labour market of thousands of ex-combatants who compete with ordinary civilians for extremely scarce jobs and live- lihood opportunities. In such circumstances, ex-combatants and vulnerable youth may turn to illicit activities such as organized crime, banditry, illegal exploitation of natural resources and other socially harmful and violent activities.

Such mechanisms can transform potential conflict scenarios into reconciliation opportunities (e.g. through involving both ex-combatants and community members in finding solutions through mediation and arbitration that are acceptable to all and in line with cultural norms, where appropriate). Women, youth, children and disabled ex-combatants are among the most vulnerable groups with regard to land exclusion and disfranchisement. This not only has direct con- sequences on their livelihoods but also on their social standing within their communities. DDR planners and managers must keep in mind that in rural areas, traditional laws are likely to be those most abided by the population. In these systems, women may not tradi- tionally have access to property rights, but rather to user rights through their husbands and families. Should they find themselves widowed, separated or single for any reason, their livelihoods may be threatened unless recourse to traditional/local authorities is made on their behalf (see also IDDRS 5.10 on Women, Gender and DDR).",

In that it aims to reestablish the State as the sole authority over the use of violence, DDR is inherently part of the overall political strategy during peacemaking, peacekeeping and peace-building. While political reintegration is related to this strategy, its goals are far more specific, focusing on integrating programme participants into the political processes of their communities and countries at both the individual and group level.",

The guidance is also designed for civilian DDR practitioners who are interested in the ways that military personnel may be able to support their work. The module discusses the factors to be considered when employing military capacity in support of DDR. Routine military tasks that are carried out according to national security policies and strategies are beyond the scope of this module.",

In order to bring the many different stakeholders in a conflict or post-conflict country (and region) together in support of DDR, it is essential to ensure that they are aware of how DDR is meant to take place and that they do not have false expectations about what it can mean for them. Changing and managing attitudes and behaviour – whether in support of or in opposition to DDR – through information dissemination and strategic communication are therefore essential parts of the planning, design and implementation of a DDR process.

In other words, whereas public information seeks to provide relevant and factually accurate information to a specific audience, strategic communication involves complex messaging that may evolve along with the DDR process and the broader strategic objectives of the national authorities or the UN. It is therefore important to systematically assess the impact of the communicated messages. In many cases, armed forces and groups themselves are engaged in similar activities based on their own objectives, perceptions and goals. Therefore, strategic communication is a means to provide alternative narratives in response to rumours and to debunk false information that may be circulating. In addition, strategic communication has the vital purpose of helping communities understand how the DDR process will involve them, for example, in programmes of community violence reduction (CVR) or in the reintegration of ex-combatants and persons formerly associated with armed forces and groups. Strategic communication can directly contribute to the promotion of both peacebuilding and social cohesion, increasing the prospects of peaceful coexistence between community members and returning former members of armed forces and groups. It can also provide alternative narratives about female returnees, mitigating stigma for women as well as the impact of the conflict on mental health for both DDR participants and beneficiaries in the community at large.",

There are four overall objectives of PI/SC: \\n To inform stakeholders about the DDR process (public information): This includes providing tailored key messages to various stakeholders, such as where to go, when to deposit weapons, who is eligible for DDR and what reintegration options are available. The result is that DDR participants, beneficiaries and other stakeholders are made fully aware of what the DDR process involves. This kind of messaging also serves the purpose of making communities understand how the DDR process will involve them. Most importantly, it serves to manage expectations, clearly defining what falls within and outside the scope of DDR. If the DDR process is made up of different combinations of DDR programmes, DDR-related tools or reintegration support, messages should clearly define who is eligible for what. Given that, historically, women and girls have not always received the same information as male combatants, as they may be purposely hidden by male commanders or may have ‘self-demobilized’, it is essential that PI/SC strategies take into consideration the specific information channels required to reach them. It is important to note, however, that PI activities cannot compensate for a faulty DDR process, or on their own convince people that it is safe to participate. If combatants are not willing to disarm, for whatever reason, PI alone will not persuade them to do so. In such sitatutions, strategic communications may be used to create the conditions for a successful DDR process. \\n To mitigate the negative impact of misinformation and disinformation (strategic communication): It is important to understand how conflict actors such as armed groups and other stakeholders respond, react to and/or provide alternative messages that are disseminated in support of the DDR process. In the volatile conflict and post-conflict contexts in which DDR takes place, those who profit(ed) from war or who believe their political objectives have not been met may not wish to see the DDR process succeed. They may have access to radio stations from which they can make broadcasts or may distribute pamphlets and other materials spreading ‘hate’ or messages that incite violence and undermine the UN and/or some of the (former) warring parties. These spoilers likely will have access to online platforms, such as blogs and social media, where they can easily reach and influence a large number of people. It is therefore critical that PI/SC extends beyond merely providing information to the public. A comprehensive PI/SC strategy shall be designed to identify and address sources of misinformation and disinformation and to develop tailored strategic communication interventions. Implementation should be iterative, whereby messages are deployed to provide alternative narratives for specific misinformation or disinformation that may hamper the implementation of a DDR process. \\n To sensitize members of armed forces and groups to the DDR process (strategic communication): Strategic communication interventions can be used to sensitize potential DDR participants. That is, beyond informing stakeholders, beneficiaries and participants about the details of the DDR process and beyond mitigating the negative impacts of misinformation and disinformation, strategic communication can be used to influence the decisions of individuals who are considering leaving their armed force or group including providing the necessary information to leave safely. The transformative objective of strategic communication interventions should be context specific and based on a concrete understanding of the political aspects of the conflict, the grievances of members of armed forces and groups, and an analysis of the potential motivations of individuals to join/leave warring parties. Strategic communication interventions may include messages targeting active combatants to encourage their participation in the DDR process, for example, stories and testimonials from ex-combatants and other positive DDR impact stories. They may also include communication campaigns aimed at preventing recruitment. The potential role of the national authorities should also be assessed through analysis and where possible, national authorities should lead the strategic communication. \\n To transform attitudes in communities so as to foster DDR (strategic communication): Reintegration and/or CVR programmes are often crucial elements of DDR processes (see IDDRS 2.30 on Community Violence Reduction and IDDRS 4.30 on Reintegration). Strategic communication interventions can help to create conditions that facilitate peacebuilding and social cohesion and encourage the peaceful return of former members of armed forces and groups to civilian life. Communities are not homogeneous entities, and individuals within a single community may have differing attitudes towards the return of former members of armed forces and groups. For example, those who have been hit hardest by the conflict may be more likely to have negative perceptions of returning combatants. Others may simply be happy to be reunited with family members. The DDR process may also be negatively perceived as rewarding combatants. When necessary, strategic communication can be used as a means to transform the perceptions of communities and to combat stigmatization, hate speech, marginalization and discrimination against former members of armed forces and groups. Women and girls are often stigmatized in receiving communities and PI/SC can play a pivotal role in creating a more supportive environment for them. PI/SC should also be utilized to promote non-violent behaviour, including engaging men and boys as allies in promoting positive masculine norms (see IDDRS 5.10 on Women, Gender and DDR). Finally, PI/SC should also be used to destigmatize the mental health impacts of conflict and raise awareness of psychosocial support services.",

Political leaderships may or may not represent the military branches of their organizations. \\n The military leadership of armed forces and groups: These leaders may have motivations and interests that differ from the political leaderships of these entities. Likewise, within these military leaderships, mid-level commanders may hold their own views concerning the DDR process. DDR practitioners should recognize that the rank-and-file members of armed forces and groups often receive information about DDR from their immediate commanders, who may have incentives to provide disinformation about DDR if they are reluctant for their subordinates to leave military life. \\n Rank-and-file of armed forces and groups: It is important to make the distinction between military leaderships, military commanders, mid-level commanders and their rank-and-file, because their motivations and interests may differ. Testimonials from the successfully demobilized and reintegrated rank-and-file have proven to be effective in informing their peers. Ex-combatants and persons formerly associated with armed forces and groups can play an important role in amplifying messages aimed at demonstrating life after war. \\n Women associated with armed groups and forces in non-combat roles: It is important to cater to the information needs of WAAFAG, especially those who have been abducted. Communities, particularly women’s groups, should also be informed about how to further assist women who manage to leave an armed force or group of their own accord. \\n Children associated with armed forces and groups: Individuals in this group need child-friendly, age- and gender-sensitive information to help reassure and safely remove those who are illegally held by an armed force or group. Communities, local authorities and police should also be informed about how to assist children who have exited or been released from armed groups, as well as about protocols to ensure the protection of children and their prompt handover to child protection services. \\n Ex-combatants and persons formerly associated with armed forces and groups with disabilities: Information and sensitization to opportunities to access and participate in DDR should reach this group. Families and communities should also be informed on how to support the reintegration of persons with disabilities. \\n Youth at risk of recruitment: In countries affected by conflict, youth are both a force for positive change and, at the same time, a group that may be vulnerable to being drawn into renewed violence. When PI/SC strategies focus only on children and mature adults, the specific needs and experiences of youth are missed. \\n Local authorities and receiving communities: Enabling the smooth reintegration of DDR participants into their communities is vital to the success of DDR. Communities and their leaders also have an important role to play in other local-level DDR activities, such as CVR programmes and transitional WAM as well as community-based reintegration support.",

The following partners are often the secondary audience of a DDR process; however, depending on the context, they may also be the primary audience (e.g., the international community in a regionalized armed conflict): \\n Civil society: This includes women’s groups, youth groups, local associations and non- governmental organizations that play a role in the DDR process, including those working as implementing partners of national and international governmental institutions. \\n Religious leaders and institutions: The voices of moderate religious leaders can be amplified and coordinated with educators to foster coordination and promote messages of peace and tolerance. \\n Legislative and policy-setting authorities: The legal framework in the country regulating the media can be reviewed and laws put in place to prevent the distribution of messages inciting hate or spreading misinformation. If this approach is used, care must be taken to ensure that civil and political rights are not affected. \\n International and local media: International and local media are often the main source of information on progress in the peace process. Keeping both media segments supplied with accurate and up-to-date information on the planning and implementation of DDR is important in order to increase support for the process and avoid bad press. The media are also key whistleblowers that can identify, expose and denounce potential spoilers of the peace process. \\n Private sector: Companies in the private sector can also be important amplifiers and partners, for example, by generating specific recruitment advertisements in support of reintegration opportunities. Local telecommunication companies and internet service providers can also offer avenues to further disseminate key messages. \\n Opinion leaders/influencers: In many contexts, opinion leaders are public personalities who actively produce and interpret multiple sources of information to form an opinion. With the advent of social media, these actors generate viewership and large followings through regular programming and online presence. \\n Regional stakeholders: These include Governments, regional organizations, military and political parties of neighbouring countries, civil society in neighboring States, businesses and potential spoilers. \\n The international community: This includes donors, their constituencies (including, if applicable, the diaspora who can influence the direction of DDR), troop-contributing countries, the UN system, international financial institutions, non-governmental organizations and think tanks.",

It is important for DDR practitioners to keep in mind that former members of armed forces and groups are not usually a standard target audience within a mission’s PI/SC strategy. They may therefore need to engage with the PI/SC office in order for this group to be considered. In non-mission settings, DDR practitioners may seek out partnerships with relevant organizations or explore the possibility of bringing on board or working with existing PI/SC personnel.

It is therefore appro- priate, in the reconstruction period, to focus resources on women and men who are still active fighters and potential spoilers. Women who have already rejoined their communities can, however, be an important asset in the rein- tegration period, including through playingexpanded roles in the security sector, and efforts should be made to include their views when designing reintegration processes.

It is therefore the responsibility of all DDR planners to work with female representatives and women’s groups, and to make it difficult for male leaders to exclude women from the form- ulation and implementation of DDR processes. Planners of SSR should also pay attention to women as a resource base for improving all aspects of human security in the post-conflict period.

A narrow definition of who qualifies as a ‘combatant’ came about because DDR focuses on neutralizing the most potentially dangerous members of a society (and because of limits imposed by the size of the DDR budget); but leaving women out of the process underesti- mates the extent to which sustainable peace-building and security require them to participate equally in social transformation.",

Gender is part of the broader sociocultural context. Other important criteria for sociocultural analysis include class, race, poverty level, ethnic group and age.4 The concept of gender also includes the expectations held about the characteristics, aptitudes and likely behaviours of both women and men (femininity and masculinity). The concept of gender is vital, because, when it is applied to social analysis, it reveals how women’s sub- ordination (or men’s domination) is socially constructed. As such, the subordination can be changed or ended. It is not biologically predetermined, nor is it fixed forever.5 As with any group, interactions among armed forces and groups, members’ roles and responsibili- ties within the group, and interactions between members of armed forces/groups and policy and decision makers are all heavily influenced by prevailing gender roles and gender rela- tions in society.

Prevention efforts should start early—when possible, they should commence prior to armed conflict—and they should take place continuously throughout the conflict, with careful consideration given to the structural, social and individual factors associated with the risk of recruitment and re-recruitment.",

In respect to DDR processes for children, this shall include consideration of how a child’s experience in conflict impacts upon his/her own evolving capacities, as well as recognition of the resilience displayed in surviving and overcoming difficulties. \\n The child’s right to be free from arbitrary detention - No child shall be deprived of his or her liberty unlawfully or arbitrarily. The arrest, detention or imprisonment of a child shall be in conformity with the law and shall be used only as a measure of last resort and for the shortest appropriate period of time. \\n The child’s right to fair justice and fair treatment - States recognize the right of every child alleged as, accused of, or recognized as having infringed the penal law to be treated in a manner consistent with the promotion of the child's sense of dignity and worth, which reinforces the child's respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of others and which takes into account the child's age and the desirability of promoting the child's reintegration and the child's assuming a constructive role in society. States shall seek to promote the establishment of laws, procedures, authorities and institutions specifically applicable to children alleged as, accused of, or recognized as having infringed the penal law, and, in particular \\n The physical and psychological recovery and social reintegration of child victims: States shall take all appropriate measures to promote physical and psychological recovery and social reintegration of a child victim of: any form of neglect, exploitation, or abuse; torture or any other form of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; or armed conflicts. DDR practitioners shall work with States to ensure that recovery and reintegration takes place in an environment which fosters the health, self-respect and dignity of the child. Article 7 of the OPAC forms the legal basis for support to CAAFAG through the obligation of signatories to rehabilitate and socially reintegrate CAAFAG. \\n The child’s right to be free from discrimination: States shall ensure respect for the rights of all children within their jurisdiction – including non-national children – regardless of race, sex, age, religion, ethnicity, opinions, disability or any other status of the child or the child’s parents or legal guardians. DDR practitioners shall pay particular attention to ensuring the full involvement and inclusion of girls and their children, as well as addressing any stigmatization of CAAFAG. \\n The child’s right to participate: Children shall be allowed to express their opinions freely and participate in making decisions concerning family reunification and career and educational opportunities, and those opinions should be given due weight in accordance with the age and maturity of the child. Children shall be consulted at all stages of the release and reintegration process, and actions that affect them shall be in their best interests, considering their needs and concerns, placement and family. \\n The child’s best interests as a primary consideration: Actions that affect the child should be based on an assessment of whether those actions are in the child’s best interests. As part of DDR processes for children, this shall mean that all measures to assure release, protection, reintegration and prevention of re-recruitment shall be determined by their best interests.

How does age- and gender-based norms and practices feature in the armed force/group’s ideology? \\n How is the armed force or group structured? Where is the locus of power? How many levels of hierarchy exist? Does the leadership have tight control over its forces? What roles are traditionally assigned to children within the force/group? Whom do children associated with armed forces and groups report to? Is reporting the same for boys and girls? How is authority/rank established?

Where does the armed force/group do most of its recruiting? Is recruitment ‘voluntary’, forced or compulsory? Looking back over three, six and twelve months, has recruitment been increasing or decreasing, and does it differ over the course of the year? Are children promised anything when they join up (e.g., protection for their families, money, goods, weapons)? What is the proportion of children in the armed force/group? \\n What conditions did the children live in while in the armed force/group? How do the children feel about their conditions? Was there exploitation or abuse, and if so, for how long and of what kind? How are boys and girls affected differently by their recruitment and use by the armed force/group? What kind of work did children perform in the armed force/group? How has 17 children’s behaviour changed as a result of being recruited? Have their attitudes and values changed? What were the children's perceptions of the armed force/group before recruitment? \\n How do children recruited understand their role in the conflict? Are there any perceived benefits for children to join armed forces/groups (i.e., status recognition, addressing grievances)? What are their expectations and aspirations for the future? How can their experiences be harnessed for productive purposes? \\n What do the communities feel about the impact of the conflict on children? How do communities view the role of children in armed forces and groups? What impact is this likely to have on the children’s reintegration? How has the conflict affected perceptions of the roles of girls and women? What are the community’s perceptions of sexual violence against boys and girls? What is the people’s understanding of children’s responsibility in the conflict? What social, cultural and traditional practices exist to help children’s reintegration into their communities?

            "Paragraph": "In addition to the context analysis, DDR practitioners and child protection actors should take the following Minimum Preparedness Actions into consideration when planning. These actions (outlined below) are informed by the Interagency Standing Committee’s Emergency Response Preparedness Guidelines (2015): \\n Risk monitoring is an activity that should be ongoing throughout implementation, based on initial risk assessments. Plans should be developed detailing how this action will be conducted. For CAAFAG, specific risks might include (re-)recruitment; lack of access to DDR processes; unidentified psychosocial trauma; family or community abuse; stigmatization; and sexual and gender-based violence. Risk monitoring should specifically consider the needs of girls of all ages. \\n Risk monitoring is especially critical when children self-demobilize and return to communities during ongoing conflict. Results should be disaggregated to ensure that girls and other particularly vulnerable groups are considered. \\n Clearly defined coordination and management arrangements are critical to ensuring a child-sensitive approach for DDR processes, particularly given the complexity of the process and the need for transparency and accountability to generate community support. DDR processes for children involve a number of agencies and stakeholders (national and international) and require comprehensive planning regarding how these bodies will coordinate and report. The opportunity for children to be able to report and provide feedback on DDR processes in a safe and confidential manner shall be ensured. Moreover, an exit strategy should feature within a coordinated approach. \\n Needs assessments, information management and response monitoring arrangements must be central to any planning process. The needs of boy and girl CAAFAG are multifaceted and may change over time. A robust needs assessment and ongoing monitoring of the reintegration process for children is essential to minimize risk, identify opportunities for extended support and ensure the effective 18 protection of all children – especially vulnerable children – involved in DDR. Effective information management should be a priority and should include disaggregated data (by age, sex, ethnicity, location, or any other valid variable) to enable DDR practitioners and child protection actors to proactively adapt their approaches as needs emerge. It is important to note that all organizations working with children should fully respect the rights and confidentiality of data subjects, and act in accordance with the “do no harm” principle and the best interests of children. \\n Case management systems should be community-based and, ideally, fit within existing community-based structures. Case management systems should be used to tailor the types of support that each child needs and should link to sexual and/or gender-based violence case management systems that provide specialized support for children who need it. Because reintegration of children is tailored to the individual needs of a child over time, a case management system is best to both address those needs and to build up case management systems in communities for the long term. \\n Reintegration opportunities and services, including market analysis are critical to inform an effective response that supports the sustainable economic reintegration of children. They should be used in conjunction with socioeconomic profiles to enable the development of solutions that meet market demand as well as the expectations of child participants and beneficiaries, taking into account gendered socio-cultural dynamics. See IDDRS 5.30 on Youth and DDR, sections 7 and 8, for more information. \\n Operational capacity and arrangements to deliver reintegration outcomes and ensure protection are essential to DDR processes for children. Plans should be put in place to enhance the institutional capacity of relevant stakeholders (including UN agencies, national and local Governments, civil society and sectors/clusters) where necessary. Negotiation capacity should also be considered in situations where children continue to be retained by armed forces and groups. The capacity of local service providers, businesses and communities, all of which will be directly involved on a daily basis in the reintegration process, should also be supported. \\n Contingency plans, linked to the risk analysis and monitoring system, should be developed to ensure that DDR processes for children retain enough flexibility to adapt to changing circumstances.",

CAAFAG are often at great risk of gender-based violence, including sexual violence, and hence may require a range of gender-specific services and programmes to support their recovery. Children, especially girls, are often not identified during DDR processes as they are not always considered to be full members of an armed force or group or may be treated as dependents or wives. Furthermore, DDR practitioners are not always properly trained to identify girls associated with or formerly associated with armed forces and groups and cater to their needs. Often, girls who informally leave armed forces or groups do so to avoid stigmatization or reprisal, or because they are unaware that they have the right to benefit from any kind of support. For these reasons, specific mechanisms should be developed to identify girls formerly associated with armed forces and groups and inform them about the benefits they may be entitled to through child-sensitive DDR processes. In order not to put girls at risk, this must be done in a sensitive manner, for example, through organizations and groups with which girls are already involved, such as health care facilities (particularly those dealing with reproductive health), religious centres and organizations that assist survivors of sexual violence (see IDDRS 5.10 on Women, Gender and DDR).",

It should also recognize that boys and men may also become associated with armed forces and groups due to expectations about the gender roles they should perform, including roles as protector and bread winner even at young ages, particularly where a father has died or is missing, and about social norms that promote violence and/or taking up arms as acceptable or preferred measures to resolve problems. This community-based approach is necessary to help promote the empowerment of girls by educating traditional patriarchal communities on gender equality and thus work towards countering harmful gender norms that enable violence to flourish. Other gender transformative approaches critical for boys include: \\n Non-violent forms of masculinities: Often through socialization into violence or through witnessing the use of violence while with armed forces and groups, boys may develop an association of violence through social norms surrounding masculinity and social recognition. Such associations may in turn lead to the development of anti-social behaviour towards themselves, to girls or vulnerable groups, or to community. Supporting boys in deconstructing violent or militarized norms about masculinity is an essential part of breaking the cycle of violence and supporting successful reintegration. This may also involve supporting emotional skill development, including understanding and working with anger in a healthy way. \\n Gender-Equitable Relations and Structures: The ideology, structure and treatment of women or girls in armed forces and groups may have led to the development of non-equitable views regarding gender norms, which may affect notions of what ‘consent’ is. Supporting equitable norms, views, and approaches to being in relationship with girls, and cultivating respect for agency and choice of girls and women, is critical to supporting boys formulate healthy norms and relationships in adulthood.",

This may include communal healing ceremonies, supportive parenting programmes, formal and non-formal educational activities, livelihood activities and the activation of social networks. \\n\\n Focused, non-specialized supports: More-affected children will require interventions by trained and supervised personnel in areas such as psychological first aid and basic mental health care by primary health-care workers. \\n\\n Specialized services: Targeting the most affected children who exhibit serious mental health and psychosocial symptoms and require either (a) referral to specialized services, if they exist, or (b) initiation of longer-term training and supervision of primary/general health- care providers.",

Is a range of approaches being used in the age assessment? \\n When selecting professionals to conduct an age assessment, select only those without a vested interest in the outcome, and who are independent from any agencies and actors that would provide services or support to the child or who would become responsible for the child if they are assessed as being a child. Are the professionals engaged in the assessment independent? \\n Subject to the wishes of the child, support him or her throughout the process of assessment, including by informing the child in a language he or she understands, and providing a guardian, legal or other representative to accompany them during the entire process. Is the child supported throughout the process? \\n Develop and conduct the age assessment process in a culturally and gender sensitive way using practitioners who are fully familiar with the child’s cultural and ethnic background. Is the assessment sensitive to cultural and gender needs? \\n Protect the child’s bodily integrity and dignity at every stage of the process. Is the process free from humiliation, discrimination, or other affront? \\n Conduct the age assessment in an environment that is safe for children, which supports their needs and is child appropriate. Is the process consistent with child safeguarding principles and child-friendly? \\n\\n Post procedure \\n Provide any services and support relevant to the outcome of the assessment without delay. What services and support are required to address the person’s identified needs? \\n If any doubt remains about the age of the child, ensure that this is applied to the advantage of the child. Has any doubt about the child’s age been resolved in favor of the child? \\n As promptly as is reasonably practical, explain the outcome and the consequences of the outcome to the child.

As with children associated with armed forces or armed groups, engagement in armed conflict negatively affects the stages of social and emotional development as well as educational outcomes of young people. Conflict may create barriers to youth building basic literacy and numeracy skills, and gaps in key social, cognitive and emotional development phases such as skill building in critical thinking, problem solving, emotional self- regulation, and sense of self-identity within their community and the world. When schools close due to conflict or insecurity, and there are few opportunities for decent work, many young people lose their sense of pride, trust and place in the community, as well as their hope for the future. Compounding this, youth are often ignored by authorities after conflict, excluded from decision- making structures and, in many cases, their needs and opinions are not taken into account. Health care services, especially reproductive health care services, are often unavailable to them. The accumulation of these factors, particularly where insecurity exists, may push young people into a cycle of poverty and social exclusion, and expose them to criminality, violence and (re-)recruitment into armed forces or groups. These disruptions also reduce the ability of communities and States to benefit from and harness the positive resilience, energy and endeavour of youth.",

Weapons surveys for disarmament and/or T-WAM activities should also include youth and youth organizations as sources of information, analyse the patterns of weapons possession among youth, map risk and protective factors in relation to youth, and identify youth-specific entry points for programming (see IDDRS 4.10 on Disarmament, IDDRS 4.11 on Transitional Weapons and Ammunition Management and MOSAIC 6.20 on Children, Adolescents, Youth and Small Arms and Light Weapons). It is also important for intergenerational issues to be included in the conflict/context assessments that are undertaken prior to a youth-focused DDR process. This will elucidate whether it is necessary to include reconciliation measures to reduce inter-generational conflict in the DDR process. Gender analysis including age specific considerations should also be conducted. For more information on DDR-related assessments, see IDDRS 3.11 on Integrated Assessments.",

DDR practitioners should also be aware that: \\n Youth participation in armed conflict is not always driven by negative motivations. Volunteerism into armed groups can be driven by a desire to change the social and political landscape in positive ways and to participate in something bigger than oneself. \\n Gender must be considered when considering reasons for youth engagement. Although an increasing number of young women and girls are involved in conflicts, particularly the longer conflicts continue, young men and boys are over-represented in armed forces and groups. This pattern is most often a result of societal gender expectations that value aggressive masculinity and peaceable femininity. While young women and girls often serve armed forces and groups in non- fighting roles and their contributions can be difficult to measure, their participation, reintegration and recovery is critical to peace building processes as marginalized women and girls remain at higher risk of (re)recruitment. Societal expectations may have implications for the roles of young women and men in conflict, as well as how they reintegrate following conflict (see IDDRS Module 5.10 Gender and DDR). It is important to understand the drivers for recruitment and re- recruitment, including the different challenges that male and female youth may experience.; \\n CVR and community-based reintegration programmes can be useful in preventing the (re-) recruitment of youth (see section 7.4 and IDDRS 2.30 on Community Violence Reduction and IDDRS 4.30 on Reintegration); \\n Young people can play a crucial role in preventing the spread of rumours that may fuel recruitment and armed conflict, particularly through social media. Different youth networks and organizations may use their connections to fact-check rumours and then spread corrected information to their communities; \\n ‘Safe spaces’ that may take the form of youth centres or other contextually appropriate and gender sensitive form are recommended to be created as a place for young people to interact with each other. Centres that allow youth to meet off the streets and experience non-violent excitement and social connection can provide alternatives to joining armed forces or groups, offer marginalized youth a space where they feel included, and provide spaces to educate youth about the realities of life in armed groups. These centres can also help with training and employment efforts by, for example, organizing job information fairs and providing referrals to employment services and counselling. Informal youth drop-in centres may also attract young former combatants who are vulnerable to re-recruitment, and who did not go through DDR because of fear or misinformation, or because they managed to escape and are looking for help by themselves. Well-trained mentors who act as role models should manage these centres; \\› Interaction between different youth organizations, networks and movements as well as youth centres, platforms and councils or others similar entitiescan provide opportunities to build trust between members of different communities.

Costs can be prohibitive, and older youth may be pressured into employment. For those youth who do return to education, many experience diminished educational attainment.

Youth should not feel stigmatized because they lost the opportunity to acquire an education, served in armed forces or groups, became refugees, or were not able to attend school for other reasons. Youth should also not be prevented from attending school due to costs, or because they are parents or hold other responsibilities (e.g., main household earner). The best solution may be to provide youth who have missed out on education with Accelerated Learning Programmes (ALP), which are designed and tailored for older learners and that are compatible with and recognized by the formal system of education (see section 7.9.4 in IDDRS 5.20 on Children and DDR). This may require the development of creative modalities for the provision of catch-up education in order to remain sensitive to the needs of youth, overcome obstacles, and maximize accessibility. For example: //n Begin education (basic literacy, numeracy and primary education) during demobilization and begin youth on a trajectory that will enable easier integration into formal education. //n Develop education programmes for different subsets of youth who are former members of armed forces and groups to best take into account their ability to learn and their level of development and maturity (e.g., through remedial education). //n Provide initial bridging education in separate facilities (for a short time only) to build up to a minimal level of educational attainment before entering mainstream classes. //n Train and mentor teachers in the provision of education to vulnerable, at-risk youth. //n Train teachers to promote peaceful coexistence and adapt curricula accordingly. //n Provide child-care facilities at all schools offering education for youth, to allow young mothers and youth who have responsibilities for dependents to attend. Childcare should be free and include a feeding/nutritional programme. //n Deliver vocational training on a part-time basis, so that it is possible to use the rest of the week for regular catch-up education. The mix of education and vocational training provides former combatants with a broader basis for finding long-term employment than simple vocational training. This system has the additional advantage of increasing the number of places available at training centres, which exist only in a limited number, as trainees will only attend two half-days of training a week, allowing many more people to be trained than if only one group attended full-time.",

Businesses owned by former members of armed forces and groups regularly fail due to market saturation, competition with highly qualified people already running the same kinds of businesses, limited experience in business start-up, management and development, and because of the very limited cash available to pay for goods and services in post-war societies. Youth may also be in competition for limited job opportunities with more experienced adults.",

Transitional WAM also aims to reduce accidents and save lives by addressing the immediate risks related to the possession of weapons, ammunition and explosives. In order to design effective transitional WAM measures targeting youth, it is essential to understand the factors contributing to the proliferation and misuse of weapons, ammunition and explosives. As outlined in MOSAIC 6.20 on Children, Adolescents, Youth and Small Arms and Light Weapons, armed violence puts youth at risk by threatening their security, health, education, wellbeing and development, both during and after conflict. By far the greatest risk of death and injury by gunshot is borne by young males aged 15 to 29. The risks to and behaviour of young men are often influenced by social and group norms related to masculinity and manhood. As young men constitute the primary victims and perpetrators of armed violence, they should play a central role in the development of transitional WAM initiatives. Equally, young women, both as victims and perpetrators can offer an alternative and no less important perspective. While it may not be possible to keep youth physically separate from weapons and ammunition in the context of a transitional WAM initiative (such as when youth are handing over weapons during a collection programme), such physical separation should be imposed to the extent possible in order to minimise risks. It should also be kept in mind that youth may be targeted by individuals, such as former commanders, who seek to discourage T-WAM initiatives. Special attention should therefore be given to ensuring their protection and security.

Such laws should not apply to children. In addition, as for adults, expressions of support for particular groups, acts, or ideologies that do not rise to the level of legally defined crimes, should not constitute criminal offenses. Children should not be interrogated as a suspect or prosecuted due to the actual or alleged affiliation of a family member. With respect to children suspected of committing crimes, due consideration shall be given to children’s right to child-specific due process and minimum standards based on their age, needs and specific vulnerabilities, including for example, the right to legal representation, prioritizing the child’s best interests, protections against self- incrimination, and support from their families (see IDDRS 5.20 Children and DDR for more guidance). Any processes for youth who were recruited and used by an armed force or group as children but who were demobilized as adults should consider their status as a child at the time of the alleged offense and the coercive environment under which they lived or been forced to act. For example, a youth who is demobilized as an adult, but became associated as a child and who is suspected of committing a crime before reaching the age of 18, should, be subject to the criminal procedure relevant for juveniles in the jurisdiction and the court should consider the fact that the individual was recruited as a child as a mitigating factor. If a youth is suspected of committing multiple offences, some before and some after he or she has reached 18 years of age, states should consider establishing procedures that allow the application of juvenile procedures in respect of all offences alleged to have been committed, when there are reasonable grounds to do so.6",

However, combatants are not the only people who are highly mobile in times of complex emergency. Given that the majority of people fleeing across borders are civilians seeking asylum, it remains vital for the civilian and humanitarian character of asylum to be preserved by host States, with the support of the international community. Combatants must therefore be separated from civilians in order to maintain States’ internal and external security and to safeguard asylum for refugees, as well as to find appropriate long­lasting ways of assisting the various population groups concerned, in accordance with international law standards.",

This article should be read and interpreted within the wider spirit of the Charter, and parti­ cularly article 1, which includes among the aims of the UN the maintenance of international peace and security, the development of friendly relations among nations and the resolution of international problems. Therefore, in addition to refraining from actions that might endanger peace and security, States also have a duty to take steps to strengthen peace and encourage friendly relations with others. Article 2(4) provides the foundation for the premise that States have an obligation to disarm, separate and intern foreign combatants.",

            "Paragraph": "What methods are there for identification? \\n Self-identification. Especially in situations where it is known that the host government has facilities for foreign combatants, some combatants may identify themselves voluntarily, either as part of military structures or individually. Providing information on the availability of internment camp facilities for foreign combatants may encourage self-identification. Groups of combatants from a country at war may negotiate with a host country to cross into its territory before actually doing so, and peacekeepers with a presence at the border may have a role to play in such negotiations. The motivation of those who identify themselves as combatants is usually either to desert on a long-term basis and perhaps to seek asylum or to escape the heat of battle temporarily. \\n Appearance. Military uniforms, weapons and arriving in troop formation are obvious signs of persons being combatants. Even where there are no uniforms or weapons, military and security officials of the host country will often be skilful at recognizing fellow military and security personnel — from appearance, demeanour, gait, scars and wounds, responses to military language and commands, etc. Combatants’ hands may show signs of having carried guns, while their feet may show marks indicating that they have worn boots. Tattoos may be related to the various fighting factions. Combatants may be healthier and stronger than refugees, especially in situations where food is limited. It is important to avoid arbitrarily identifying all single, able-bodied young men as combatants, as among refugee influxes there are likely to be boys and young men who have been fleeing from forced military recruitment, and they may never have fought. \\n Security screening questions and luggage searches. Questions asked about the background of foreigners entering the host country (place of residence, occupation, circumstances of flight, family situation, etc.) may reveal that the individual has a military background. Luggage searches may reveal military uniforms, insignia or arms. Lack of belongings may also be an indication of combatant status, depending on the circumstances of flight. \\n Identification by refugees and local communities. Some refugees may show fear or wariness of combatants and may point out combatants in their midst, either at entry points or as part of relocation movements to refugee camps. Local communities may report the presence of strangers whom they suspect of being combatants. This should be carefully verified and the individual(s) concerned should have the opportunity to prove that they have been wrongly identified as combatants, if that is the case. \\n Perpetrators of cross-border armed incursions and attacks. Host country authorities may intercept combatants who are launching cross-border attacks and who pose a serious threat to the country. Stricter security and confinement measures would be necessary for such individuals.",

Reuniting family members or putting them in contact with each other and providing skills training, peace education and rehabilitation programmes will also aid demobilization.

It may keep them in camps and even confine them in fortresses or in places set apart for this purpose. It shall decide whether officers can be left at liberty on giving their parole not to leave the neutral territory without permission.” Internment therefore does not necessarily require complete loss of liberty, and host States could grant internees varying degrees of freedom of movement, as long as the foreign combatants can no longer participate in hostilities from the neutral States’ territory. The host government should therefore decide what level of freedom of movement it wants to allow internees and set up a system to regulate movement in and out of internment camps. In order to be able to monitor the movement of internees properly and prevent them from engaging in unlawful activities, including use of the host country’s territory for military purposes, it is likely to be necessary for internment to involve at least some level of confinement. Depending on the local circumstances (mainly the extent of the security risk), this may range from a closed camp with no external freedom of movement to systems that provide for freedom of movement (e.g., a pass system that permits visits outside the camp or a system of reporting to authorities).",

International agencies’ partners (e.g., local Red Cross societies) may be able to provide mobile health clinics, to supplement hospital treatment for more serious medical matters. Medical care should include reproductive health care for female internees. \\n Non-food items. Items such as plastic sheeting, plates, buckets, blankets, sleeping mats, soap, etc. will be needed for each internee and agency contributions will be essential. Agencies such as UNHCR and ICRC, if they have the resources, may be able to give extra assistance at least temporarily until the government receives regular donor funding for the internment initiative. \\n Registration and documentation.

Agencies will often need the data themselves, e.g., ICRC in order to arrange family tracing and family visits, and UNHCR for the purpose of getting information on the profiles of internees who may later come within their mandate if, at a later stage, internees apply for refugee status. ICRC may issue its own documentation to internees in connection with its detention-monitoring role. \\n Skills training. To combat the problem of idleness and to provide rehabilitation and alternative skills for internees, as well as to maintain order and dignity during internment, agency partners must try to provide/fund vocational skills training programmes as soon as possible. In order for demobilization and reintegration to start in internment camps, it is essential to have skills training programmes that could help internees to become rehabilitated. Social skills training would also be helpful here, such as sensitization in human rights, civic education, peace-building, HIV/AIDS, and sexual and gender-based violence. \\n Recreation. Sufficient space for recreation and sporting equipment should be provided for the purpose of recreation. \\n Re-establishing family links. ICRC, together with national societies, should try to trace family members of internees, both across borders and within the host country, which will allow family links to be re-established and maintained (e.g., through exchange of Red Cross messages). Where civilian family members have also crossed into the host country, arrangements should be made for maintaining family unity. There are various options: families could be accommodated in internment camps, or in a separate nearby facility, or in a refugee camp or settlement. If family members are voluntarily accommodated Level 5 Cross-cutting Issues Cross-border Population Movements 17 5.40 together with or near to internees, this has the advantage of preserving family unity, helping to break down military hierarchies in internment camps, reducing risks of local/refugee community retaliation against the family members on account of their connections to combatants, and minimizing the chances of combatants moving to civilian sites in order to be with their family members. However, the family members may face security risks, including physical violence and sexual harassment, from internees. Where civilian spouses and children are not accommodated with internees, regular and adequate family visits to internment camps must be arranged by ICRC, UNHCR or other relevant agencies. \\n Monitoring. ICRC should be able to carry out regular, confidential monitoring of internment camps, including the treatment of internees and the standards of their internment, in accordance with its mandate for persons deprived of their liberty for reasons related to armed conflict. Reports from monitoring visits will be provided on a confidential basis to the government of the host country. \\n Host communities. The involvement and support of host communities will be vital to the internment process. Therefore, agencies should consider providing host communities with community-based development assistance programmes.",

It is recommended that assessments should be carried out in the country of asylum, where the child should already be well known to, and should have a relationship of trust with, relevant agencies in the refugee camp or settlement. The assessment can then be given to relevant agencies in the country of origin when planning the voluntary repatriation of the child, and decisions can be made about whether and how to include the child in a DDR programme. If it is recommended that a child should be included in a DDR programme, he/she should receive counselling and full information about the programme (also see IDDRS 5.30 on Children and DDR).",

UNHCR negotiates with countries of asylum for local integration, and this process should be supported by UN missions and agencies. Local integration involves: \\n Legal processes: Refugees are granted an increasingly wider range of rights and entitlements identical to those enjoyed by other citizens, e.g., freedom of move­ ment; family reunification in the country of asylum; access to education, the labour market, public relief and assistance, including health facilities; the possibility of acquiring and disposing of property; and the capacity to travel out of and return to the country of asylum with valid travel and identity documents. This process should gradually lead to permanent residence rights and the option to apply for citizenship in accordance with national laws; \\n Economic processes: Refugees become increasingly less reliant on humanitarian assistance or State aid, achieving a growing degree of self­reliance and having permanent jobs, thus contributing to the economic life of the host country; \\n Social and cultural processes: These are interactive processes involving refugees feeling more and more at home in their new country, and local communities accept­ ing their presence with greater ease, which allow refugees to live among the host population without fear of discrimination and contribute actively to the social life of their country of asylum; \\n\\n Resettlement: Third­country resettlement may be appropriate for certain refugees who were formerly combatants, e.g., where the refugee has protection needs that cannot be met in the country of asylum, is unlikely to integrate into the host country, etc. However, despite UNHCR advocacy for assistance from the international community, it is often difficult to find resettlement opportunities for refugees who were former combatants. Some resettlement countries do not take former combatants, with sometimes varying definitions of what exactly a former combatant is. Therefore, resettlement to a third coun­ try is unlikely to be a viable option for large numbers of former combatants, although it may be a solution in individual cases. The fact that very few countries take former com­ batants could be used to encourage the host country to accept them for local integration.",

Conclusion No. 48 (XXXVIII) on military or armed attacks on refugee camps and settlements; Conclusion No. 47 (XXXVIII) and Conclusion No. 84 (XLVII), on refugee children and adolescents, as well as Conclusion 64 (XLI) on refugee women and international protection; \\n\\n Recalling also United Nations Security Council resolution S/RES/1208 (1998) and S/RES/1296 (2000), and the two reports of the United Nations Secretary­General on the Protection of Civilians in Armed Conflict18, noting in particular the recommendations made therein with respect to enhancing the security of refugee camps and settlements; \\n\\n Welcoming the discussion which took place on the civilian character of asylum in the context of the Global Consultations on International Protection;19 \\n\\n Noting that several international meetings have recently been held, aimed at identifying effective operational strategies for maintaining the civilian and humanitarian character of asylum;20 \\n\\n Reiterating that refugee camps and settlements should have an exclusively civilian and humanitarian character, that the grant of asylum is a peaceful and humanitarian act which should not be regarded as unfriendly by another State, as stated in the 1969 OAU Convention Governing the Specific Aspects of Refugee Problems in Africa and a number of EXCOM Conclusions, and that all actors, including refugees themselves, have the obligation to coop­ erate in ensuring the peaceful and humanitarian character of refugee camps and settlements; \\n\\n Recognizing that the presence of armed elements in refugee camps or settlements; recruit­ ment and training by government armed forces or organized armed groups; the use of such camps, intended to accommodate refugee populations on purely humanitarian grounds, for the internment of prisoners of war; as well as other forms of exploitation of refugee situations for the purpose of promoting military objectives are likely to expose refugees, par­ ticularly women and children, to serious physical danger, inhibit the realization of durable solutions, in particular voluntary repatriation, but also local integration, jeopardize the civilian and humanitarian character of asylum and may threaten the national security of States, as well as inter­State relations; \\n\\n Recognizing the special protection needs of refugee children and adolescents who, especially when living in camps where refugees are mixed with armed elements, are particularly vul­ nerable to recruitment by government armed forces or organized armed groups; \\n\\n Reaffirming the importance of States, UNHCR and other relevant actors, integrating safety and security concerns from the outset of a refugee emergency into refugee camp manage­ ment in a holistic manner; \\n (a) Acknowledges that host States have the primary responsibility to ensure the civilian and humanitarian character of asylum by, inter alia, making all efforts to locate refugee camps and settlements at a reasonable distance from the border, maintaining law and order, curtailing the flow of arms into refugee camps and settlements, preventing their use for the internment of prisoners of war, as well as through the disarmament of armed elements and the identification, separation and internment of combatants; \\n (b) Urges refugee­hosting States to respect the civilian and humanitarian character of refu­ gee camps by preventing their use for purposes which are incompatible with their civilian character; \\n (c) Recommends that action taken by States to ensure respect for the civilian and humani­ tarian character of asylum be guided, inter alia, by the following principles; \\n (i) Respect for the right to seek asylum, and for the fundamental principle of non­ refoulement, should be maintained at all times; \\n (ii) Measures for the disarmament of armed elements and the identification, sep­ aration and internment of combatants should be taken as early as possible, preferably at the point of entry or at the first reception/transit centres for new arrivals; \\n (iii) To facilitate early identification and separation of combatants, registration of new arrivals should be conducted by means of a careful screening process; \\n (iv) Refugee camps and settlements should benefit from adequate security arrange­ ments to deter infiltration by armed elements and the strengthening of law and order; \\n (v) Once identified, disarmed and separated from the refugee population, combat­ ants should be interned at a safe location from the border; \\n (vi) Where the granting of refugee status is based on group determination, civilian family members of combatants should be treated as refugees and should not be interned together with them; \\n (vii) Combatants should not be considered as asylum­seekers until the authorities have established within a reasonable timeframe that they have genuinely and permanently renounced military activities. Once this has been established, special procedures should be put in place for individual refugee status deter­ mination, to ensure that those seeking asylum fulfil the criteria for the recogni­ tion of refugee status. During the refugee status determination process, utmost attention should be paid to article 1F of the 1951 Convention, in order to avoid abuse of the asylum system by those who do not deserve international protection; \\n (viii) Former child soldiers should benefit from special protection and assistance measures, in particular as regards their demobilization and rehabilitation; \\n (ix) Where necessary, host States should develop, with assistance from UNHCR, operational guidelines in the context of group determination to exclude those individuals who are not deserving of international refugee protection; \\n (d) Further to para 3 (b) above, calls upon UNHCR to convene a meeting of experts in sup­ port of the elaboration of measures for the disarmament of armed elements and the identification, separation, and internment of combatants, including the clarification of relevant procedures and standards, in consultation with States, United Nations Secre­ tariat entities and agencies, and interested organizations, such as the ICRC, and report back to the Executive Committee on progress achieved; \\n (e) Calls upon States to ensure that measures are taken to prevent the recruitment of refugees by government armed forces or organized armed groups, in particular of children, taking into account also that unaccompanied and separated children are even more vulner­ able to recruitment than other children; \\n (f) Calls upon the relevant United Nations organs and regional organizations, in pursuance of their respective mandates, as well as the international community at large, to mobi­ lize adequate resources to support and assist host States in maintaining the civilian and humanitarian character of asylum, in line with the principles of international solidarity, co­operation, burden and responsibility sharing; \\n (g) Calls upon UNHCR and the Department of Peacekeeping Operations of the United Nations Secretariat to enhance collaboration on all aspects of this complex matter, and as appropriate, to deploy, with the consent of host States, multi­disciplinary assess­ ment teams to an emerging crisis area in order to clarify the situation on the ground, evaluate security threats for refugee populations and consider appropriate practical responses; \\n (h) Calls upon UNHCR to explore how it may develop, in consultation with relevant part­ ners, its own institutional capacity to address insecurity in refugee camps, inter alia by assisting States to ensure the physical safety and dignity of refugees, building, as appro­ priate, upon its protection and operational expertise.",
