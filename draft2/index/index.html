                  The Integrated DDR Standards have been formulated through the joint efforts of 25 UN entities, which together form the Inter-Agency
                  Working Group on DDR (IAWG). Between 2009 and 2014, the IDDRS have been updated with new and revised modules. In 2017, the IAWG took
                  the decision to undertake a comprehensive review of the IDDRS, which culminated with the launch of the revised UN Approach to DDR in
                  2019.<br /><br />The IDDRS were originally developed to provide guidance in post-conflict contexts where DDR forms an integral part of
                  comprehensive peace agreements, usually where peace operations have also been established and mandated to support national DDR
                  efforts.
                </p>
                <p class="">
                  Following the 2017-2019 IDDRS review, the revised UN Approach to DDR provides guidance to DDR practitioners working in both mission
                  and non-mission settings as well as for DDR efforts within and outside the framework of comprehensive peace agreements.<br /><br />The
                  Integrated Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration Standards (IDDRS) have been formulated through the joint efforts of 25 UN
                  entities, which together form the Inter-Agency Working Group on DDR (IAWG), and guide the United Nations systemâ€™s support to
                  Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration (DDR) processes.

                        Each programme design cycle, including the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) programme design cycle, has three stages:
                        (1) detailed field assessments; (2) detailed programme development and costing of requirements; and (3) development of an implementation 
                        plan. Throughout the programme design cycle, it is of the utmost importance to use a flexible approach. While experiencing each stage of
                        the cycle and moving from one stage to the other, it is important to ensure coordination among all the participants and stakeholders 
                        involved, especially national stakeholders. A framework that would probably work for integrated DDR programme design is the postÂ­conflict 
                        needs assessment (PCNA), which ensures consistency between United Nations (UN) and national objectives, while considering differing 
                        approaches to DDR.<br/><br/>
                        Before the detailed programme design cycle can even begin, a comprehensive field needs assessment should be carried out, focusing on 
                        areas such as the countryâ€™s social, economic and political context; possible participants, beneficiaries and partners in the DDR programme; 
                        the operational environment; and key priority objectives. This assessment helps to establish important aspects such as positive or negative 
                        factors that can affect the outcome of the DDR programme, baseline factors for programme design and identification of institutional 
                        capacities for carrying out DDR.<br/><br/>
                        During the second stage of the cycle, key considerations include identifying DDR participants and beneficiaries, as well as performance 
                        indicators, such as reintegration opportunities, the security situation, size and organization of the armed forces and groups, 
                        socioÂ­economic baselines, the availability and distribution of weapons, etc. Also, methodologies for data collection together with analysis 
                        of assessment results (quantitative, qualitative, mass surveys, etc.) need to be decided.<br/><br/>
                        When developing DDR programme documents, the central content should be informed by strategic objectives and outcomes, key principles of 
                        intervention, preconditions and, most importantly, a strategic vision and approach. For example, in determining an overall strategic approach 
                        to DDR, the following questions should be asked: (1) How will multiple components of DDR programme design reflect the realities and needs of 
                        the situation? (2) How will eligibility criteria for entry in the DDR programme be determined? (3) How will DDR activities be organized into 
                        phases and in what order will they take place within the recommended programme timeÂ­frame? (4) Which key issues are vital to the 
                        implementation of the programme? Defining the overall approach to DDR defines how the DDR programme will, ultimately, be put into operation.
                        <br/><br/>
                        When developing the results and budgeting framework, an important consideration should be ensuring that the programme that is designed 
                        complies with the peacekeeping resultsÂ­based budgeting framework, and establishing a sequence of stages for the implementation of the 
                        programme.<br/><br/>
                        The final stage of the DDR programme design cycle should include developing planning instruments to aid practitioners (UN, nonÂ­UN and 
                        government) to implement the activities and strategies that have been planned. When formulating the sequence of stages for the 
                        implementation of the programme, particular attention should be paid to coordinated management arrangements, a detailed work plan, timing 
                        and methods of implementation.<br/><br/>

                    The reintegration of ex-combatants and persons formerly associated with armed forces and groups is a long-term process with social, economic 
                    and political dimensions. It may be influenced by factors such as the choices and capacities of individuals to shape a new life, the security 
                    situation and perceptions of security, family and support networks, and the psychological well-being and mental health of ex-combatants and the 
                    wider community. Reintegration processes are part of the development of a country. Facilitating reintegration is therefore primarily the responsibility
                    of national Governments and their institutions, with the international community playing a supporting role if requested..<br/><br/>

                    Efforts to support the transition of ex-combatants and persons formerly associated with armed forces and groups into civilian life have typically 
                    taken place as part of post-conflict DDR programmes. During DDR programmes assistance is often given collectively, to large numbers of DDR participants 
                    and beneficiaries, as part of the implementation of a Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA). However, when the preconditions for a DDR programme are not in place,
                    reintegration support can still play an important role in sustaining peace. The twin UN resolutions on the 2015 peacebuilding architecture review, General Assembly 
                    resolution 70/262 and Security Council resolution 2282, recognize that efforts to sustain peace are necessary at all stages of conflict. This renewed UN policy 
                    engagement emerges from the need to address ongoing armed conflicts that are often protracted and complex. In these settings, individuals may exit armed forces 
                    and groups during all phases of an armed conflict. This type of exit will often be individual and can take different forms, including voluntary exit or capture.<br/><br/>

                    and groups during all phases of an armed conflict. This type of exit will often be individual and can take different forms, including voluntary exit or capture.<br/><br/>

                    The reintegration of ex-combatants and persons formerly associated with armed forces and groups is a long-term process with social, economic 
                    and political dimensions. It may be influenced by factors such as the choices and capacities of individuals to shape a new life, the security 
                    situation and perceptions of security, family and support networks, and the psychological well-being and mental health of ex-combatants and the 
                    wider community. Reintegration processes are part of the development of a country. Facilitating reintegration is therefore primarily the responsibility
                    of national Governments and their institutions, with the international community playing a supporting role if requested..<br/><br/>

                    Efforts to support the transition of ex-combatants and persons formerly associated with armed forces and groups into civilian life have typically 
                    taken place as part of post-conflict DDR programmes. During DDR programmes assistance is often given collectively, to large numbers of DDR participants 
                    and beneficiaries, as part of the implementation of a Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA). However, when the preconditions for a DDR programme are not in place,
                    reintegration support can still play an important role in sustaining peace. The twin UN resolutions on the 2015 peacebuilding architecture review, General Assembly 
                    resolution 70/262 and Security Council resolution 2282, recognize that efforts to sustain peace are necessary at all stages of conflict. This renewed UN policy 
                    engagement emerges from the need to address ongoing armed conflicts that are often protracted and complex. In these settings, individuals may exit armed forces 
                    and groups during all phases of an armed conflict. This type of exit will often be individual and can take different forms, including voluntary exit or capture.<br/><br/>

                    Each programme design cycle, including the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) programme design cycle, has three stages:
                    (1) detailed field assessments; (2) detailed programme development and costing of requirements; and (3) development of an implementation 
                    plan. Throughout the programme design cycle, it is of the utmost importance to use a flexible approach. While experiencing each stage of
                    the cycle and moving from one stage to the other, it is important to ensure coordination among all the participants and stakeholders 
                    involved, especially national stakeholders. A framework that would probably work for integrated DDR programme design is the postÂ­conflict 
                    needs assessment (PCNA), which ensures consistency between United Nations (UN) and national objectives, while considering differing 
                    approaches to DDR.<br/><br/>
                    Before the detailed programme design cycle can even begin, a comprehensive field needs assessment should be carried out, focusing on 
                    areas such as the countryâ€™s social, economic and political context; possible participants, beneficiaries and partners in the DDR programme; 
                    the operational environment; and key priority objectives. This assessment helps to establish important aspects such as positive or negative

                    When reintegration support is provided during ongoing conflict, it should aim to strengthen resilience against re-recruitment and also to 
                    prevent additional first-time recruitment. To do this it is important to strengthen what still works, including the residual capacities for 
                    peace that people and communities draw on in times of conflict. The strengthening of peace capacities can be based on the identification of 
                    the reasons why some individuals do not join armed groups, and why some combatants leave armed groups and turn away from armed violence.<br/><br/>
                    There will be additional challenges when supporting reintegration during ongoing conflict. Support to reintegration as part of sustaining peace
                    requires analysis of the intended and unintended outcomes precipitated by engagement in dynamic, conflict-affected environments. DDR practitioners
                    and others involved in the provision of reintegration support should understand how engagement in such contexts has implications for social 
                    relations/dynamics â€“ positive and negative â€“ so as to â€˜do no harmâ€™ and, in fact, â€˜do goodâ€™. It should also be recognized that the risk of doing 
                    harm is greater in ongoing conflict contexts, thereby demanding a higher level of coordination among existing and planned programmes to avoid the 
                    possibility that they may negatively affect each other. In order to support the humanitarian-development-peace nexus, reintegration programme 
                    coordination should extend to broader programmes and actors.<br/><br/>
                    Before the detailed programme design cycle can even begin, a comprehensive field needs assessment should be carried out, focusing on 
                    areas such as the countryâ€™s social, economic and political context; possible participants, beneficiaries and partners in the DDR programme; 
                    the operational environment; and key priority objectives. This assessment helps to establish important aspects such as positive or negative
